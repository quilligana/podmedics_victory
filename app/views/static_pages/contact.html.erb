        <p>Podmedics was founded in 2007 based upon the idea that a 5 minute audio or video tutorial is easier to learn from than a lecture or long textbook chapter. Starting from humble recordings on a dictaphone, we now have over 150 professional-quality videos produced by doctors, medical students and other healthcare professionals.</p>
        <p>It has always been our vision that Podmedics be high quality and affordable to all. We feel that this has been achieved more than ever with the latest release with the introduction of our simple to use question and notes systems.</p>
        <p>We are always delighted to hear your feedback. If there is something you think we could be doing better just drop us an email at <a href="mailto:feedback@podmedics.com">feedback@podmedics</a>    </p>
