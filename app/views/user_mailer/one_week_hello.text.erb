Dear <%= @user.name %>,

It's been about a week since you signed up to Podmedics.

We hope you are enjoying the site and finding it a useful addition to your medical learning.

Here are a few tips of new things you can do:

- Do questions and earn badges (medical student to consultant)
- Take a look at our flashcards for each specialty
- Earn points by completing videos

Do drop me an email if you need help with anything, and keep learning!

All the best,

Ed
Podmedics - Director
