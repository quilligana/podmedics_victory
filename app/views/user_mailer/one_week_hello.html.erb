  <h1>Dear <%= @user.name %></h1>

  <p>
  It's been about a week since you signed up to Podmedics.
  </p>

  <p>
  We hope you are enjoying the site and finding it a useful addition to your medical learning.
  </p>

  <p>
  Here are a few tips of new things you can do:
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>
    1. Do questions and earn badges (medical student to consultant)
  </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>
    2. Ask questions in any of our specialties and have them answered by us and others from the community
  </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>
    3. Earn points by completing videos
  </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>
    4. Signup for a Podmedics subscription to get access to all specialties and downloads. It's cheap, only £12 for 6 months
  </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
  Do drop me an email if you need help with anything, and keep learning!
