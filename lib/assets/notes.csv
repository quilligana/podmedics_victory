Abdominal radiographs,"Abdominal radiographs looked over in favour of the CT scan. &nbsp;Better to have an overview. Abdominal x ray is a signficant dose. There are four basic radiodensities when assessing abminal films<br><b>intra-luminal and extra-luminal gas </b>should be assessed in abdominal x rays<br>calcification in the absdomen such as gall-stones or renal stones should be asessed. Anterior posterior projection should be assessed. Air fluid levels can be seen in supine or erect decubitus. pneumoperitoneum should be seen. The name of the patient, age , film date and gender, position and penetration should all be noted. Name , gender date of birth and position. Some of the aptients iliac crest is not visible when you see the penetration .A normal distribution of bowel gas can be seen.&nbsp;<br><br>Key aspects of abdominal film that can be seen is the distrubtion of gas within the film, be it intra- or extraluminal Can be an indication of both small and large bowel pathology. Small bowel is usually centrall which has indication of bowel which cross all the way across the bowel with hautra which cross all the way across. Visualised when there is some pathological change.&nbsp;<br><br>A clear cut off can be seen in the ileocaecal valve which can be seen at an obstruction.&nbsp;<br><br>Valvulae conniventes running across the bowell and thin lines that run across it. There is a clear cut-off at the ileo-caecal valve. There is no gas visible at the rectum. Abnormal gas pattern in the periphery seen in the large bowel. consistent with parlytic ileus seen. No cut0ff between large and small bowel. Patients with symptoms have payltic ileus is where food cease to move. Electrolyte imbalance and electroyte imbalance and excessive amount of analgesia. Abnormal intravalvular gas pattern. &nbsp;Volvulus &nbsp;is a twisting of the bowel upon its mesentry.&nbsp;<br>Coffee bean is an extremely dilated loop of bowel running from the left iliac fossa and running down. Likely to consisten with a sigmodi <b>volvulus. LArge single loop of bowel arising from the right iliac fossa is likely to cosnitent with a caecal volvulus.<br><br>Patients who have undergone laprotomy may have gas under the peritoneum,. Gas may be seen in the right or left diaphragm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shadow seen on both sides of the bowel wall which is refferred to commonly as riglers sign. Collangitis and necrotizing enterocolitis are what lead to it most commonly. Some films will aptly show calcification of the abdomen. Intramural thickening an dcalcification can be seen in the region overlying an abdominal aortic aneurism. In the right upper quadrant, an umber of small white lesions cosistent of gall stones. On 10% of gallstone are radiolopaque and visible so only an ultrasound is used.&nbsp;<br>(0% of renal stones are radioopaque and used for th epurposed of diagnosis.&nbsp;<br><br>These will invovle the injection of contrast to creat a intravenous urogram where a control will be used in pre and post mictursation are taken within the radiogrpah.

Back pain,"&nbsp;vertebral column - 7c, 12t, 5l, 4coccygeal verterbra.<br><br>spinal cord sits in spinal foramen, begins at foramen magnum and ends at l1/2. as it ends before spinal cord you have long nerve roots for l3-s5 as cauda equina.<br><br>cervical lordosis, kyphosis of thoracic and lumbar lordosis- normal.<br><br>surface anatomy - t3 is at the level of the medial part of the spine of the scapula.<br>t7 is at the inferiro level of the scapula<br>l4 is at the highest point of iliac crset<br>s2 is at posterior superior iliac spine.<br>c7 - lower part of neck as prominece.<br><br>Sinister causes of back pain - spinal cord compression, cauda equina syndrome, vertebral fracture, infection or malignancy.<br><br>Symptoms for these are 'red flags'.<br><br>1) spinal cord compression or cauda equina can become compressed due to tumour, vertebral fracture or intervertebral disc herniation. <br><br>SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION: Patients usually have back pain at the level of the lesion and have LMN symptoms AT level of lesion but UMN symptoms BELOW level of lesion. <br><br>CAUDA EQUINA: Bilateral sciatica, saddle anaesthesia and leg weakness. Urinary retention and faecal incontinence (S2-S4). These nerve roots usually cause contraction of the detrusor muscle, contraction of external blader sphincter and external anal sphincter. CAUDA EQUINA IS AN ORTHOPEDIC EMERGENCY - REFER TO NEUROSURGEON FOR DECOMPRESSION!!!<br><br>2) Vetebral fractures - caused by significant trauma otherwise suspect pathological bone with less trauma. The fractures are usually crushing and appear in the anterior part of the vertebral body, making the bone look wedge shaped.<br>***********<br>Patients often complain of back pain on standing and they may notice some loss of height or kyphosis too. On examination, palpation&nbsp;of the fractured vertebra elicits tenderness. Fractured vertebra are best seen on MRI. Management of the patient is dependent on cause. <br><br>If the cause is high energy trauma then management should take an ABCDE approach as there are probably other coexisting problems. Treat an underlying bone disease e.g. osteoporosis (stop smoking,&nbsp;exercise/weight, take calcium supplements and perhaps&nbsp;bisphosphonates).&nbsp;<br><br>3) infection - rare but a potential complication of septicaemia - ask for dental work, pneumonias, UTIs or been immunosuppressed. back pain associated with vertebral infections is usulaly well localised.&nbsp;systemic features and localised bony tenderness!. investigatons&nbsp;= blood tests e.g. crp and esr, mantoux testing, sputum cultures [full septic screen], &nbsp;xray of vertebra but can take 6-8 weeks to see anything. note that infection can lead to fracture of vertebra if mmore severe. treat with Abiotics!<br><br>4) Malignancy - primary or secondary metastases. 90% of malignancies in the spine presen with back pain that is often described as ""focal, constant and unremitting"". If the cancer is a secondary metastasis, the patient may have symptoms of their primary malignancy e.g. rectal bleeding or abdominal pain if in bowel or haemoptysis if it is in lung.Tailor investigations to symptoms then! Main complication to worry about is spinal cord compression and therefore you should treat patients with high dose corticosteroids and radiotherapy to try and remove as much of the malginancy as possible before it compresses. Bisphosphanates may also be given to reduce bone resorption and manage bony pain. MDT approach!<br><br>Benign conditions affecting the spine: mechanical back pain, disc prolapse without spinal cord compression, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, ankylosing spondylitis.<br><br>1) Mechanical back pain is very common e.g. due to overuse of a structure in the back like a muscle. Often is in the lowe back and is worse on&nbsp; movement and there is often morning stiffness ++. typically relieved by rest. On examination, there may be loss of normal lumbar lordosis due to spasming of the injured muscles. on palpation of paraspinal muscles there can be tenderness. Management is analgesia and encourage movement (prolonged bed rest has been shown to delay recovery).<br><br>2) Disc prolapse - tear of the annulus of IV disc can lead to herniation of nuclues propulsus (irritates nerve roots)&nbsp;- patients usually report a history of leaning forwards, hearing a popping sound and experiencing pain afterwards. L5-S1 disc is most common. Backpain and leg pain in distribution of sciatic nerve are common. Ask about red flag symptoms thinking about compression of spinal cord!! if none, then it is probably irritating nerve roots causing sciatic pain. On examination, the straight leg raising test (SLR) is usually positive (pain reproduced between 30 and 70 degrees of flexion). Most diagnoses are clinically but you can do a MRI.With time, disc prolapses will heal themeslves mostly. The patient should keep active (physiotherapy)&nbsp;and have adequate analgesia. Surgical options include discectomy and spondylodesis (remove disc and then fuse vertebra alongside it). This is only for a recurring problem.<br><br>3) spinal stenosis - decrease in diameter of spinal canal/intervertbral foramina - common causes are spondylolisthesis, OA, prolapse or paget's disease. Typically patients describe progressively worsening back pain as well as pain in the legs that is worse during exercise and relieved by sitting down or leaning forwards - i.e. pain relieved by postural change. This pain mechanism is known as neurogenic claudication and the narrowing of the spinal canal means that the veins supplying the spinal canal are slightly compressed so venous return is impeded and you get venous congestion. If the patient does any exercise, venous return from legs increases and blood flow through the spinal cord veins increases too. the venous congestion therefore gets worse, veins dilate more and they compress underlying nerve roots causing irritation and pain. Venous return decreases when exercises is reduced. Investigations: MRI or CT scan as these show narrowed spinal canal. Management is symptomatic - physiotherapy and analgesia. If severe, spinal surgery can be considered!<br><br>4) Spondylolisthesis - one vertebrae slips forward relative to the one above. L5 is most commonly involved - patients may complain of lower back pain that is worse on standing and can radiate to buttocks. On examination you may see an increase in the normal lumbar lordosis and on palpation of the spine you may be able to feel a displacement of the affected vertebra. To aid diagnosis, you should do a lateral plane x-ray of the spine. Spinal MRI or CT would also be useful to determine spinal cord narrowing - management is similar to spinal stenosis. If patients develop cauda equina symptoms - be cautious!!!<br><br>5) Ankylosing spondylitis is a seronegative arthropathy that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints.<br><br>Yellow flags for back pain - set of risk factors&nbsp;that determines&nbsp;poorer prognosis of the patient - &nbsp;wrong beliefs about pain, sick role adoption, false treatment expectations, co-existing psychological/social factors are all yellow flags.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",10498,17,76,2013-10-03 09:25:48 UTC,2013-10-03 10:16:49 UTC
Ankle ,"The ankle joint is formed by the fibula, tibia and talus and there are a ring of ligaments which hold it in place. Laterally (fibula to talus) there is the anterior talo-fibular ligament (ATFL). Medially there is the deltoid (means triangle) ligament between the talus and the tibia which also attaches to calcaneus. And then there is the syndesmosis which is between the tibia and fibula. The syndesmosis is used as a land mark in Weber Ankle fracture classification, where A is below the syndesmosis, B is parallel and C is above. Weber C is usually considered unstable.<br><br>*rupture of syndesmosis&nbsp;ligaments (diastasis)&nbsp;causes a gap between the tibia and fibula.<br><br>It is the ATFL that goes tense pulling bone off the lateral maleolus that can cause an avulsion fracture.<br><br>The anterior drawer test for the ankle test the ATFL. Involves grabbing the distal end of the leg with your right hand the back of the heel with your left hand. Pull the heel anteriorly/towards you, while pushing with the right hand. Test for anterior dislocation of the ankle that could separate the foot from the ankle.<br><br>Deltoid and calcanofibular ligamnet test is&nbsp;the talar tilt test. Grasp lateral side of foot with right hand underneath and thumb on top and left hand being the base on the end of the leg. Bring about an inversion, i.e. twist foot inwards. this tests the calcanofibular ligament. Eversion test is for the deltoid ligament.<br><br><br>*syndesmosis: syndesmosis is made up of anterior-inferior tibiofibular ligament, interosseous 
ligament, and posterior-inferior fibular ligaments,<br>            inferior

hip fractures,"Hip fractures are divisible into intracapsular fractures (proximal to the insertion of the hip capsule on the femoral neck), and extracapsular (again divisible itnto subtrochanteric and intertrochanteric). Intracapsular fractures disrupt the retinacular arteries that run up theh neck - cause avasculra necrosis.<br><br>key to treating intracapsular fractures is based on the level of the displacement on the x-ray. if it is displaced, head is excised and replaced/artroplasty - if non-displaced, head is saved and may be fixed with screws.<br><br>garden - 1,2 screw, 3,4&nbsp; austin moore.<br><br>hemiarthroplasty - large prosthetic femoral head sitting in native acetabulum, beneath that there is a femoral stem fixed into the femur with surrounding cement. complications - infection at site, dislocation, acetabular wear.<br><br>screw fixation - cannuluated screws.complications - non-union, femoral head avn, loss of position.<br><br>extracapsular fractures - fracture distal to capsule so no risk of AVN.<br><br>intertrochanteric fractures - usually fairly stable, treat with a dynamic hip screw, if complex with lots of pieces, may also use intramedullary nail.<br><br>subtrochanteric fracutres are not stable - treat with intramedullary nail and screw.<br><br>prevent vte and pressure sores, early mobilization, bone protection.<br>",10498,17,203,2013-10-01 18:49:43 UTC,2013-10-01 19:05:38 UTC

torch,"<div>The TORCH test, which is sometimes called the TORCH panel, belongs to a category of blood tests called infectious-disease antibody titer tests. This type of blood test measures the presence of antibodies (protein molecules produced by the human immune system in response to a specific disease agent) and their level of concentration in the blood. The name of the test comes from the initial letters of the five disease categories. The TORCH test measures the levels of an infant's antibodies against five groups of chronic infections:&nbsp;<i>t</i>oxoplasmosis,<i>o</i>ther infections,&nbsp;<i>r</i>ubella,&nbsp;<i>c</i>ytomegalovirus (CMV), and&nbsp;<i>h</i>erpes simplex virus (HSV). The ""other infections"" usually include&nbsp;<a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Syphilis"">syphilis</a>, hepatitis B, coxsackie virus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, and human parvovirus.</div><div>Since the TORCH test is a screening or first-level test, the pediatrician may order tests of other body fluids or tissues to confirm the diagnosis of a specific infection. In the case of&nbsp;<a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Toxoplasmosis"">toxoplasmosis</a>, rubella, and syphilis, cerebrospinal fluid may be obtained from the infant through a spinal tap in order to confirm the diagnosis. In the case of CMV, the diagnosis is confirmed by culturing the virus in a sample of the infant's urine. In HSV infections, tissue culture is the best method to confirm the diagnosis.</div>",10105,22,126,2013-09-26 05:51:01 UTC,2013-09-26 05:51:01 UTC

Ischaemic Heart Disease,"Atherosclerosis causes ischaemic heart&nbsp;disease. This is the narrowing of the blood vessels which leads to the heart getting oxygen less quickly making it become ischaemic. &nbsp;This can lead to the heart tissue dying. This affects the output of the heart and therefore the perfusion of cells around the body. This is heart failure.&nbsp;<br><br>In atherosclerosis, fatty streaks form from macrophages and cholesterol. Over time it builds up and hypertension damages the endothelium. This forms an atherosclerotic plaque thus blocking the lumen. This can be enough to cause ischaemic. If the plaque ruptures stimulates thrombsis formation and can embolise further down the vessel and that can block the blood vessel and prevent blood getting to part of the heart. Thus causing a myocardial infarction. Stenosis (narrowing) is more chronic and causing angina whereas an acute event is a rupture causing a heart attack. A person with a massive myocardial infarction may never have had angina as stenosis wasn't great enough to cause pain.&nbsp;<br><br>Risk factors<br>Framingham study - a longitudinal cohort study which establishes risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease and methods for reducing risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;<div>Risk factors can be divided between modifiable and non-modifiable or high and low risk. Modifiable risk factors (we can influence) are: smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia (statins) and diabetes compared with non-modifiable (we cannot affect)&nbsp;factors: increasing age, male sex and family history.&nbsp;<br><br>Ischaemic heart disease manifests itself as chronic stable angina and acute coronary syndrome: unstable agina, NSTEMI and STEMI (heart attack).&nbsp;<br>Angina is a chest pain on exertion and relieved on rest. GN spray can relieve it.&nbsp;It is caused by atherosclerosis. Patients without atherosclerosis can get angina though. There may not be anything to find on examination. An ECG may be normal or show non-specific changes in the ST segment. Following an MI it may manifest in Q waves. It can also be completely asymptomatic. A way to determine if a patient's chest pain is due to&nbsp;ischaemia is to do an exercise tolerance test as you may begin to see ischaemic changes on an ECG e.g. ST depression. You can then go on to do an angiogram to see if there is any stenosis and go on to do angioplasty. Angiography can be therapeutic as well as diagnostic investigation.<br><br>Acute coronary syndrome&nbsp;<br>It isn't a diagnosis, just how the patient is presenting. Patient presents with: chest pain, nausea, vomiting,shortness of breath and sweating. This is due to dythorsis &nbsp;which is due to over sympathetic drive. Underlying diagnosis depends on whether the heart is damaged. Acute coronary syndrome is often caused by an embolism blocking off vessel. Cardiac enzymes allow you to understand what is going on in the heart, troponin. Troponin can be measured and can see if patient has any underlying damage. It doesn't tell you the cause just if part of the heart is dead, usually due to ischaemic heart disease.&nbsp;<br><br>Following an infarct, measure troponin levels 12 hours after the onset of pain.&nbsp;<br><br>Unstable angina is a type of acute coronary syndrome. Symptoms include:&nbsp;chest pain at rest.There is&nbsp;acute/chronic (stable) angina. When chronic angina gets worse it becomes acute with a&nbsp;recurrence of chest pain following previous MI.<br>In angina, an&nbsp;ECG shows signs of ischaemia and ST depression.&nbsp;Unstable angina produces normally levels of cardiac troponin, therefore it won't be raised. This highlights there is no damage to the myocardium (of the heart) from the ischaemic attack.&nbsp;<br><br>NSTEMI - very similar to unstable angina.&nbsp;</div><div>ECG shows ischaemic changes such as T wave conversion or ST segment depression. Cardiac enzymes are the key feature. They are not raised in unstable angina whereas in NSTEMI you get a raise in troponin T/I 12 hours&nbsp;following an MI. Then you perform an echo myocardial function and angiography to identify to identify and confirm the presence of athersclerosis.&nbsp;<br><br>STEMI - clinical features are the same&nbsp;</div><div>ECG shows ST elevation.&nbsp;<br><br>Treatment:&nbsp;<br>The treatment is the same for all acute coronary syndrome. Manage all patients the same, suspected MI or ACS.&nbsp;<br>Resusitate the patient<br>Give them high flow o2<br>300mg aspirin<br>300mg clopidogrel (anti-platelets shown to reduce mortality from MI)<br>heparin<br>sublingual nitrates (GTN spray dilate vessels )<br>10mg morphine - analgesic for pain and&nbsp;vasodilation of blood vessels.&nbsp;<br>10mg metoclopramide iV&nbsp;<br><br>Looking at an ECG if the patient has ST elevation they require emergency care so should be transferred to a tertiary unit to have PCI/angioplasty. If not available you can thrombolyse the patient.&nbsp;<br><br>Management:&nbsp;<br>cardiac enzyme measurement - +angiography -exercise tolerance test if + then angiography<br>aspirin<br>clopidogrel<br>ACE inhibitor<br>statin<br>beta blocker? if not bradycardic.&nbsp;</div><div>These drugs have all been shown to reduce mortality from MI.&nbsp;<br><br>Atherosclerosis leads to vessel&nbsp;stenosis which causes angina and then as stenosis causes occlusion of the vessel due to plaque rupture with thromboembolus goes on to cause ACS, of which there are 3 - unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI. Unstable angina has normal troponin, NSTEMI has raise troponin and STEMI, ST elevation seen therefore needs urgent PCI or thrombolysis.<br><br><br><br><br></div>",10562,2,7,2013-09-04 20:30:12 UTC,2013-09-04 22:59:51 UTC

A heart larger than half the diameter of the chest cavity indicates heart failure and cardiomegaly. Also, look at the lung fields as a patient with cardiac failure may present with pulmonary oedema too. Diuretics may be used to try and reduce the fluid and another x-ray to observe any improvements.<br><br>Echocardiography<br>Harder to get hold of than chest x-ray. Information about the structure of the heart and any abnormalities as well as the function of the heart. Looking at the amount of blood being pumped and the ventricle contraction. Also, doppler can be used to observe the blood movement and blood through particular valves. This helps to identify any valvular pathologies.&nbsp;<br><br>Cardiac MRI - more advanced, valves and walls of heart and the heart in motion. Help to identify hyper and hypokinesis. Infarction and ischaemic cause part of the heart to hibernate. Following angioplasty/opening up the vessel to maximise bloodflow again the heart can completely recover.&nbsp;<br><br>Angiography - ischaemic heart disease to identify stenosis in specific vessel.&nbsp;<br><br>ECG - used for chest pain and helps to determine the pathology and localise it.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Treatment can be conservative, medical or interventional. Conservative is associated with lifestyle management where you alter the lifestyle to reduce the risk factors of the disease. Also, a variety of different drugs can be used.&nbsp;Moreover, interventional techniques include: angioplasty, coronary artery bypassing grafting for really bad ischaemic heart disease&nbsp;and transplant mainly used to treat&nbsp;cardiomyophathy.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Drugs can be split into different classes: anti-platelets/anti-coagulants and thrombolytics look at the blood constituents in order to reduce further risk of thrombus formation in patients with ischaemic heart disease. Aspirin has been good and reduced mortality following MI. Thrombolytic therapy has shown to positively affect patients having an&nbsp;ST elevation MI but not eligible for PCI. Also, the other drugs have an impact on the function of&nbsp;the heart: ACE inhibitors, Beta blockers, Calcium channel blockers and Diuretics (ABCD). These drugs can be used for a variety of heart conditions e.g. heart failure and hypertension. The other type of drug are anti-arrhythmics used to treat arrhythmas.<br><br></div>",10562,2,5,2013-09-04 19:16:44 UTC,2013-09-04 20:18:56 UTC

menstrual cycle explanation,"1) day 1-4 of the cycle is menstruation caused by necrosis of endometrium from constriction of the spiral arterioles in the superficial layer of endometrium due to corpus luteum degeneration and thus low levels of progesterone.<br><br>2) progesterone is no longer having a negative feedback effect on the ant pituitary and gonadtrophins increase in level. FSH causes follicle growth stimultion and lh causes thecal cells to produce androgens which are aromatized into estrogens. rising level of oestradiol ensues.<br><br>3) oestrogen has negative feedback effect on lh and fsh. Meanwhile after day 4 the endometrium has sloughed off and is regrowing. day 9-13 the rising level of oestrogen has an opposite effect and causes increased fsh and lh level rising leading to a lh surge. The primary follicle has been selected and ovulation occurs. the other follicle cells form the corpus luteum which secretes progesterone and if fertilization does not occur then it decays. Otherwise is maintained by trophoblast [until the placenta secretes beta hcg ??].<br><br>4) progesterone causes increased gland and glandular secretion in side the superficial layer of the endometrium making it more inhabitable.

(1) Start the clock
(2) Dry, wrap and stimulate the baby
(3) Assess the baby - A(appearance) P(pulse) G(grimace) A(activity/tone) R(respiratory effort)

A No resuscitation required, dry and wrap

B Not breathing, good heart rate 
- open airway
- x5 inflation breaths (2-3s)
- reassess 

C Blue, floppy baby, not breathing, low heart rate
*failure to estabilish regular breathing within 60 seconds is an indication to assist ventilation
- obtain patent airway: neutral position, suctioning
- x5 inflation breaths (30cm H2O term, 20-25cm H2O preterm, air)
- reassess

Heart rate is still slow...
Did chest expand? 
NO - reposition airway, repeat inflation breaths 
(neutral position, one.two handed jaw thrust, oropharyngeal airway, check for obstruction)
YES - chest compressions if HR <60bpm, 3:1 (compressions: ventilations)
Continue for 30 seconds, then reassess

Indications for intubation
(1) >32 weeks failure to respond to facemask ventilation in 2-3 min
(2) 28-32 weeks may need CPAP or intubation if there is not adequate spontaneous respiration 
(3) <28 weeks requires intubation to administer surfactant

For resuscitation?
(1) 25 weeks and above - resuscitation started unless severe abnormality incompatible with life
(2) 24 weeks - full invasive intensive care unless parents/clinicians agree not in best interest
(3) 23 weeks - precedence should be given to wishes of parents (poor prognosis)
(4) less than 23 weeks - should not resuscitate baby

Gets deposited in tissues - sclera, skin. 2-3 times normal serum before seen clinically.<br>1. Pre hepatic (achloric): Physiological (neonate)&nbsp;Haemolysis, sphereocytosis, elliptocytosis, autoimmune haemolytic, TTP. Usually mild - 'lemon tinge' - anaemic and jaundiced<br>2. Hepatic : hepatitis, alcohol, RV thrombosis, drugs, Gilberts (inherited defect in glucronyl transferase)/Crigler Najjar, cirrhosis, malignancy, Wilsons, Haemochromatosis, failure to excrete conjugated bili (dubin-johnson/rotor syndromes), Right heart failure, toxins, paracetamol, anti TB, statins, valoporate, MAO inhibitors.<br>3. Post hepatic : gallstones, head of pancreas tumour, cholangicarcinoma (PSC)&nbsp;strictures (repeated ERCP/inflammation), PBC, PSC, extramural tumour. Most profound clinical signs - deep yellow. Think luminal, mural and extra mural. Lymph nodes at the porta hepatis, gold, flucolox, nitro, fusidics acid, steroids, COC, chlorpromazine, sulphyureas.<br><br>Need to rule out malaria as a cause of haemolysis. Think of in any traveller. Infectious causes - viral hepatitis.<br>Investigations : FBC, U&amp;E, LFTs, blood culture, urine culture, serology.&nbsp;AST/ALP gives you an idea of where problem may be - ALP = bilary.<br>IgM is acute immunoglobulin. Therefore Hep A IgM = new infection. IgG is old infection. Albumin is a key synthetic function - therefore low in chronic disease. Normal = acute picture.<br><br>Upper abdo pain radiating to right shoulder, urine dark, tender in RUQ worse on inspiration (Murphys sign - cant take breath with hand in RUQ due to pain). Female, fat, fertile, forty - gallstones. Cholecystits? Stones? excess urobilinogen = post hepatic cause. Cholangitis. Very serious condition which can result in septicaemia. ALP is very high. Do USS : gallstones and dilated common bile duct. ERCP to have gallstones removed. Then cholecystectomy.<br><br>19 yr recovering from URTI - now jaundiced. Reticulocytes are immature RBC high in haemolysis.&nbsp;Urine is bilirubin negative. Unconjugated form can not be excreted in the urine as is not water soluble. Therefore must be pre hepatic cause.

Is preceded by dysplasia when it has not yet invaded BM - endoscopy every 2 yrs). Low grade dysplasia - 6 months rebiopsy. High grade - oesphagectomy.<br>2. Ca : malignant epithelial tumours. 2 types : squamous (increased risk with smoking, alcohol and achalasia, mid 1/3) and adeno (increased with barretts - lower 1/3) Presentation tends to be late with progressive dysphagia (solids, liquids, own secretions) and malaise and weight loss)<br>3. Achalasia : motility disorder. Lower oesphageal sphincter fails to relax and smooth muscle fails to move food down. Loss of myenteric plexus - Auerbachs. Becomes dilated. Immune mediated. Slowly progressive dysphagia. Can develop SCC.<br><br>Stomach split into 4 parts : cardia where joins the oesphagus, fundus above, body, antrum near pylorus. Surface mucus barrier, bicarbonate ions and blood flow enables diffusion of H ions.<br>1. Gastritis : H/pylori (gr -ive, flagellated, antrum least acidic, neutralise any gastirc acid by urease) - antral predominated. 80% asymptomatic. Acid hypersecretiors - duodenitis and ulceration. Hypo secretors - colonise body of stomach - chronic atrophic gastritis due to destructions of acid secreting glands. Gastric epithelial metaplasia into intestinal type (RF of cancer) Autoimmune - parietal cells destructed - body/fundus. Get atrophy of glands ans intestinal metaplasia. Reactive/chemical - NSAIDs, alcohol. Erosive/heamorrhagic - following large volumes of chemical, or in acutely unwell patients were blood flow is decreased so H ions are not cleared away.&nbsp;<br>2. Peptic ulcers - usually solitary, affects full thickness of mucosa, tend to develop in antrum and first part of posterior wall of&nbsp;duodenum. Punched out appearance with raised edges. Sequale - heamorrhage (haematemesis), perforation (abdo pain peritonitis)&nbsp;and stricture (gastric outflow obstruction - recurrent vomiting).&nbsp;<br>3. Carcinomas - develop on the back of H.pylori/autoimmune. Mostly adeno (gland/mucin). Intestinal (h.pylori)/diffuse type (from normal mucosa - get signet rings - large volumes of intracellular mucous push nucleus to one side - highly infiltrative cancer - leather bottle)<br>4. T cell lymphoma - normal has NO lymphoid tissue. H.pylori cause recruitment of lymphocytes. Low grade. Marginal zone. Distant spread unusual. Treat with H.pylori irradication.<br>5.

Melanoma,"Definition : malignant uncontrolled proliferation of melanocytes<br>Epidemiology : 4% of all cancers. High majority of skin cancer related deaths. Incidence is only thought to increase.<br>Risk factors : Fitzpatrick skin type 1 (burns no tanning), prev melanoma, &gt;2 frist degree relatives affected (CDKN2A gene), high sun exposure, geographical location, immunosuppression, mutliple benign or atypical naevi, giant hairy naevus, sunburn &lt;10yrs old, increasing age.<br>History : change in shape, size, colour, itchy, bleeds, ulcerated, crusting, tender, ABCDE - asymmetry, border irregularity, colour irregularity, diameter &gt;6mm, elevation. Glasgow 7 point scale : 3 major = change in size, irregular colour, irregular shape. 4 minor = oozing, inflammation, &gt;7mm diameter and change in sensation.<br>Types : superficial = lentigo maligna, acral lentingious, superficial spreading (LAS who sunbathes is very superficial). Deeper : nodular, mucosal, neurotrophic and desmoplastic (MNND)<br>1. Superficial spreading - 60-70%, 50 years old, sun exposed areas (backs on men, lower limbs on women), tend to spread laterally not invading dermis, may bleed and ulcerate, indurated, white/blue discolouration, papules or plaques.<br>2. Lentigo maligna - malignant melanoma in situ, diagnosed hitologically when malignant melanocytes invade the dermis. Elderly, due to sun damage, flat, large, indolent, tan/brown/black, face/sun exposed. 1/3 evole into lentigo maligna melanoma (lentigo maligna is a precursor to it)<br>3. Acral lentingious : 5%, subungual, hands or feet, darker skinned people, ill defined dark brown/black, poorer prognosis<br>4. Nodular : very aggressive, grow vertically through dermis and basement membrane. &gt;50 years old, M&gt;F. Can grow within weeks/months. Sharp border, plaque/nodule, ulcerated/blue/black. More seen in fairer skinned.&nbsp;<br><br>Investigation :<br>1. Excisional biopsy with a 2-3mm margin - histological diagnosis<br>2. Lymphoscinitigrahy - lymph drainage and sentinel nodes.<br>3. Staging - USS/CT/MRI/CXR<br>4. Sentinel node biopsy if primary and &lt;1mm deep<br>5. Bloods : LFTs (mets)<br><br>Treatment :<br>1. Patient education - suncream and decrease sun exposure.<br>2.

Acne,"Chronic inflammatory condition affecting the pilosebaceous units (head and upper trunk)<br>40% 16-18yrs olds.<br>Aetiology : hormonal, bacterial growth, keratinization and immune hypersensitivity<br>1. Increased formation of keratin within the hair follicle<br>2. Blocks and forms micro comedome<br>3. Inflammaotory activity driven by P.acne a bacteria found around the pilsebaceous units = closed comedome/whitehead. Bacterial lipases convert lipids to fatty acids - drive inflammatory reaction.<br>4. Rupture - pro inflammatory secretions into dermis - pustules, papules and nodules.<br><br>Multiple lesions : open and closed comedomes, papules, pustules and nodules.&nbsp;<br>Nodulocystic - most scarring type<br><br>Underlying conditions - PCOS, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushings<br><br>Management :&nbsp;<br>1. patient education : avoid excess oily skin treatments. Explore psychological aspect<br>2. topical retinoids : antimicrobial and anticomedomal affect eg. benzyl peroxide, tretioin.&nbsp;SE : irritation, stain clothes.<br>3. Topical antibiotic creams e.g. erythromycin, clindimycin. 6 months +<br>4 . Oral antibiotics - mod-severe/unresponsive. e.g. doxycycline, oxytetracycline. reassess after 3months<br>5. Oral retinoids - isotretinoin. Inhibits sebaceous glands and reducing abnormal keratinization. Very effective. SE :teratogenic, abnormal lipid profile, hepatitis.

Thick well demarcated plaques. Can be large<br>2. Flexural : arm pits, groin, breasts, anus, umbilicus. Smooth, shiny plaques. DD = seborrhoeic dermatitis.<br>3. Scalp - mild, temporary hair loss, non scarring<br>4. Guttate - tear drop, numerous all over body +/- face, ears. Few days post strep infection - do throat swab and anti streptolysin titre.<br>5. Nail - pitting, ridges, oncholysis (nail away from nail bed), oil drop, subungal hyperkeratosis<br>6. Psoriatic arthritis - DIP, poly symmetrial, axial, mutilans (telescoping)&nbsp;and oligo arthritis<br>7 Palmoplantar - erythematous pustules.<br><br>Pathogenesis - excessive proliferation of skin cells - faster transit time from stratum basale to corneum.

Anaesthetic Drugs,"<p>propofol- induction of anaesthesia, commonly used with fentanyl. 

can reduce vascular tone, therefore decreasing BP and CO.
metabolised by the liver.  it stings when going into the patients arm.  maybe inject lidocaine first?

thiopentone- used to rapid sequence induction.  short acting barbituate.  post op nausea and somnolence.  

sevoflurane- used for kids- vapour.

muscle paralysis- depolarising- suxomethonium RSI.cleared within 7mins, binds to postsynaptic receptor and doesnt get broken down, keeping it depolarised.  
eventually get broken down by pseudocholinesterase. 
nondepolarising- vecuronium- competitively bind to acetylcholine receptors, atracurium can cause bronchospasm.  however is broken down in the blood. (good in liver renal failure)

maintenance- 
gases- desflurane- irritant to the resp tree therefore not used in resp patients. 
isoflurance is cheap but takes a while to recover. 
sevoflurane best but most expensive. 

propofol infusion- 40-60 EEG 

emergency- atropine- if BP is ok but HR is low.

clinical features= hrs- days duration, infrequent to constant,
diffuse, dull, aching headache 
associated with stress 
normally no other symptoms
management= reduce stress and analgesics</p><strong>Migraine</strong><br /><br /><p>cause: vascular process associated with altered serotonine receptors- vascular spasms 
peak onset= early adult life

round ligament which supports anteversion of the uterus. It leaves the pelvis by the deep inguinal ring and eners the inguinal canal and continues to the labia majora and spreads to fibres of the mons pubis.

Pathogenesis of ectopics:
Tubal Factors - damage to tubes i.e infection increases risk 10 fold
Chromosomal factors
Hormonal factors: progesterone particularly as it decreases smooth muscle contractility.

Symptoms:
Pain and bleeding (shoulder tip pain may be described)

Managing possible ectopics:
ABC
most important first line is USS
up to 50% of the time we will be unable to exclude or confirm ectopic - if unstable treat as ectopic, however if stable we need to manage clinically.
 Serum bHCG every 48 hours.

If bHCG is > than 1500 then ultrasound should be possible. 
Normally hcg should double every 48 hours.

Progesterone: helps determine the status of pregnancy. 60 represents an ongoing pregnancy.

Treatment considerations:
Medical: methotrexate if confirmed pregnancy. they must satify criteria: no altered renal function, ectopic should be less than 3cm, no tubal perforation and BHCG less than 3000.
Follow up HCGs need to be done to follow up outcome.
The criteria for the use of methotrexate are: Unaltered renal and liver function, the pregnancy should be less than 3cm and serum Î²HCG should be less than 3000IU/L. There should also be no evidence of perforation. 
Viable pregnancy i.e ectopic with a heartbeat makes methotrexate contraindicated.

Surgical:
Laparoscopic salpingectomy: ectopic plus the tube
Laparoscopic slapingotomy --> remove the ectopic leave the tube, usually used when damage to other tube present.

Prognosis: 70 % go on to intrauterine pregnancy in future. 10% will recur.</p>",8415,20,83,2012-12-31 15:57:53 UTC,2012-12-31 15:57:53 UTC
Amenorrhoea,"<strong>Amenorrhoea</strong><br /><br /><p>primary amenorrhea failure to start menses by 16 

or failure to acquire secondary sexual characteristics by 14. 

Secondary amenorrhoea cessation of periods for greater than 6 months in premenopausal women. 

Secondary more common than primary.



Causes:
Primary: mullerian agenesis absence of uterus,
Outflow tract obstruction - imperforate hymen transverse vaginal septume etc.
Constitutional delay of puberty - important eg Kallmans syndrome , this is hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism due to a problem with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus there is failure to produce sex hormones. Kalmmans syndrome is inherited form of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (no GnRH release) associated with anosmia.

Turners syndrome - gonadal dysgenesis.

Secondary amenorrhoea: 
Commonest cause is pregnancy. DONT FORGET THAT.

Hypothalamic amenorrhoea
hyperprolactinoma
ovarian failure
hypothyroid
outflow tract obstruction - fibroids and polyps
 
implanon is progesterone only you often may not have periods full stop.

History:
dont forget eating disorder. not eating enough can suppress gnrh release.

hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism is things like Turners syndrome. You will have the release of GNRH FSH and LH but you have ovarian failure. so FSH and LH will be very high but with low estradiol.  Check for hot flushes etc.


Normogonadotrphic:
- endocrinpoathies cushings, acromegaly, PCOS
- recent endometrial trauma (i,e from curettage)

hyperprolactinoma:
ask about, galactorrhoea, headache, visual symptoms ALSO thorough drug history. 
Dopamine stops prolactin thus anything stopping dopamine will increase prolactin think of anti dopaminergics (domperidone) , antipsychotics, histamine bloackers.

investigations:
prolactin <1000 can be caused by pregancy and drugs 
>1000 we often consider a prolactin secreting tumour.

Dont forget that TSH can stimulate prolactin though so people with hypothyroidism often secrete prolactin as TSH will increase the amount of prolactin secretion.  
Hyperthyroid can also cause high or low prolactin. High if TSH is high due to overproduction of TSH by the pituitary thus increased prolactin. however it may also be low if it is simply lots of thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland thus a suppressed TSH level.

free androgen is raised in those with PCOS.

Antenatal Care,"<strong>Antental Care</strong><br /><br /><p>Pregnancy trimesters:
1st trimester is weeks 1-12
2nd trimester is weeks 13-28 
3rd weeks 29-40


A Nulliparous lady with uncomplicated pregnancy should receive 10 antenatal appointments.

A parous woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy should receive 7 appointments.

Gestational age is assessed by ultrasound between 10-14 weeks. Crown rump length is sued. this scan also looks at number of foetuses. 
Mothers will also be offered the screening for Downs now which is the combined test: nuchal traslucency PAPP-a (pregnancy associated plasma proteing and BHCG. PAPP A would be low and BHCG would be High if positive.

Those who book later in pregnancy can be offered the triple or quadruple test between 15-20 weeks which is a serum test for Downs.
This consists of AFP ) alpha fetoprotein, estriol and BHCG. inhibin A is added in the quadruple test to improve sensitivity. AFP and estriol would be low and HCG would be high in downs. inhibin would also be high.

a calculation is made through screening and if the calculated risk is greater then 1 in 250 then amniocentesis is offered for diagnosis.

High AFP is also associated with Neural Tube defects, cardiac anomalies, gastroschisis, exompholos and renal haemangioma.

Low AFP in downs

Chorionic villus sampling is done at 10 weeks and amniocentesis at 14-18 weeks these are for genetic diagnoses. women over 35 are routinely offered amniocentesis as they are at risk. However amniocentesis is associated with a 1%  risk of miscarriage.
Fetal anomaly scanning should be offered between 18 weeks and 21 weeks. 

Supplementation: folic acid should be advised preconception and up to 12 weeks. the recommended dose is 400mcg. 
if your risk of having a child with a spinal cord problem is increased then the dose is higher (5 mg a day - you need a prescription for this higher dose). That is, if:
You have had a previously affected pregnancy.
You or your partner have (or have a family of) a spinal cord defect.
You are taking medication for epilepsy.
You are obese - especially if your Body Mass Index (BMI) is 30 or more.
You have coeliac disease, diabetes, sickle cell anaemia, or thalassaemia.

Avoid liver and other things containgin vitamin A as it may be teratogenic. 

Vitamin D is now routinely encouraged at 10mcg daily especially those at greatest risk ethnic backgrounds and obese (>30kg/m)

Lifestyle: 
avoid drinking - if they choose to drink then no more than 1-2 units a week.
Stop smoking entirely no safe limits

Screening in pregnancy:
Downs
Thalassaemia 
anaemia
Sickle cell
Asymptomatic bacteriuria
Blood group and Rhesus status
Hep B virus
HIV infections
Rubella susceptibility
Syphylis
Gestational Diabetes screen by using risk factors: bmi above 30

10-20 percent need oral hypoglycaemics if diet and exercise is ineffective.

diagnosis of gestational diabetes will lead to increased monitoring during pregnancy.

Pre-eclampsia should be screened for via BP and urinalysis for portein at every antenatal visit.

Hypertension is a single reading where diastolic is >110mmHg or two readings > 90mmHh greater than 4 hours apart. and /or significant proteinureia defined as 1+ should prompt increased surveilance.

Regarding low lying placentas it is now reccommended that only women with a placenta over the OS at the anomaly scan should have a further scan at 32 weeks to reassess.

Fetal growth should be measured and assessed by symphysis fundal height from 24 weeks onwards.

Fetal presentation is only really meaningfully assessed at 36 weeks onwards.
Needs confirming by USS.


Management of pregnancy after 41 weeks:

prior to formal induction women should be offered vaginal examination and membrane sweeping. 

Uncomplicated pregnancies should be offere induction beyond 41 weeks.

Breech at term (37 weeks)
If uncomplicated singleton pregnancy at 36 weeks offer external cephalic version at 37 weeks.

IVF on its own is a high risk pregnancy.

Twin to twin transfusion is also high risk. one is donor one is recipient. the recipient of blood becomes sollen large and polycythaemic, the donor is small and anaemic. Very Dangerous.

Gastroschesis gut outside the abdomen no covering. omphalocele gut has a thin covering. The latter are associated with a high proportion of other birth defects.

Gestational diabetes is not associated with an increase risk of congenital anomalies unlike insulin dependent diabetes but it still with holds the risk of Macrosomia and other birth related comlications.

In diabetes there is a risk of IUGR or macrosomia. IUGR may occur when the diabetic has microvascular complications and macrosomia is a risk in all diabetics due to the high maternal glucose stimulating foetal insulin secretion.</p>",8415,20,127,2012-12-31 15:57:53 UTC,2012-12-31 15:57:53 UTC

1. Generalised Anxiety Disorder:
Def: Persistent and excessive anxiety that is out of place with the patient's situation.
Epi: 5% of the population
Sex: Affects more women vs. men
Age of onset: 15-25 years

Aetiology:
Genetics: Avoidant/anxious personality
Environmental - anxious parent
Stressful situations in a patients life may precipitate and perpetuate patient's symptokms

Features:
Symptoms: Described as 'free floating'
Psychological features: ( apprehensional - poor concentration ,feeling on edge/impending doom, pre-ocupation with past or future events) 
Motor: Restless , trembling and headaches
Autonomic: Lightheadedness , tachycardia , breathlessness ,sweating
Depersonalization (when patient feels a loss of personality) and derealization ( loss of surroundings) = more severe cases
Ddx:
Other psych: Panic disorder ; Phobic disorder ; OCD; Schizophrenia ; Withdrawal (DTs)
Physical: Phaeochromocytomas; Thyrotoxicosis; Unexpressed worries (e.g breast lump)

Management 
Psychological:1st Line
 Counselling ; Self help books ; Cognitive therapy ; Anxiety Management techniques
Pharmacotherapy:
Short Acting : Benzodiazepines ( diazepam) - only for max of 4 weeks due to risk of addiction
Long acting:1st line psych tx
SSRIs/SNRIs(venlaxflexine): 1st line vs TCAs or MAOI
B-blockers to treat autonomic symptoms of anxiety
Rarely , low dose antipsychotic medications may be needed. 

2. Panic Disorders:
Definition: 'Period of severe anxiety'
Epi:1-2% population
Sex: More common in females vs males
Age: 20 -40 yr

Aet:
Now thought to be more of a genetic component to heightened autonomic disorder

Ddx: Always rule out
Hyperthyroidism ;Phaeochromocytoma ; Hypoglycaemia ; Phobic disorder ; Co-morbid depressive disorder

Features:
Fear of dying or losing control - cardinal
Accompanied by severe physical symptoms: Breathlessness , chest pain , dizziness , palpitations , tremor.
If these symptoms occur in a certain situation then patients often develop an 'avoidance' of similar situations and can lead to phobias.

Management:
Psychological - Mainstay of treatment is CBT - with nearly 100% of patients successfully treated. --> Anxiety management techniques

Drugs: Less successful of around 60% and returns if 
SSRIs / Clomipramine (TCA - more effective)

Phobic Disorder:
Definition: Inappropriate Situational Anxiety together with avoidance
3 main types
Agoraphobia 'Fear of the market place' : Fear of crowds & public , open spaces --> drug and alcohol abuse common to cope with such fears
Isolated/Specific phobia: Fear of flying ,snakes , spides
Social phobia: Fear of embarrassment in social context

Most people do not seek treatment for their phobias unless it affects their ADLs i.e. it becomes functional
Epi:
Sex:

Managment:
Psychological
Behavioural therapy - most successful method and the gold standard
--> Systemic desensitization - phobic stimulus or flooding (max exp)
--> CBT (social or agro)

Pharmacotherapy:
SSRI: next in line 
TCA useful for depressive features
BZDs - before exposure to phobic stimuli to reduce panic
B-blockers


OCD: Obsessive compulsive disorder
Hallmarks: Inappropriate & intrusional thought which are only relieved by acting on various compulsions the patient may have

Obsessive thought:
Intrusive thoughts
Catastrophic thinking

Complusions: rituatals often related to 3 or a multiple of 3; may be related to obsessions 
Cleaning/washing hands
Checking lights/locks

Patients may realise that their obsessions may be silly but cannot stop the thoughts entering their mindsets

Can occur/co-exist in depressive disorders , GAD and AN


Mangement:
Psychological
CBT = effective this disorder - easier to treat rituals than ruminations 
SSRIs or TCAs - good at high doses

Anxiolytic

Antipsychotics:
Indications:
Psychotic disorders: Schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , delusional disorder
Depression/ mania with psychotic feature
Delirium
Behavioural disturbance (in dementia)
Other: Hiccups , nausea and vomiting

MOA:
Block dopamine D2 receptors in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway --> extrapyramidal side effects (EPSE) related to blockade of these receptors
2 main types:
Typical antipsychotic block all D2 receptors
Atypical antipsychotics have less affinity for D2 receptors and block 5HT2a receptors
Both block muscarinic , histaminergic and alpha adrenergic receptors

Examples:
Typical: Haloperidol ; sulpiride , flupentixol
Atypical: Clozapine , olanzapine , rispiridone , quetiapine , amisulpride

EPSE: Blockade of D2 receptors

2. Acute dystonia ( involuntary , sustained muscular contractions /spasms) e.g. ocular gyro crisis , lock jaw
3. Akathisia (motor restlessness)
4. Tardive dyskinesia ( rhythmic involuntary movements)  head , limbs or trunk - grimacing mouth 
Other S/E:
Anticholinergic: dry mouth , constipation , urinary retention , blurred vision
Alpha adrenergic receptor blockade : Postural hypotension - dizziness , syncope
Histamine blockade : Sedation , weight gain
Cardiac effects : long QT , arrhythmias , myocarditis , sudden death
Hyper-prolactinaemia ( as PRL is under the inbitory control of DA ,so when DA is decreased PRL levels increased --> ammenorhoea , gynaecomastia ,sexual dysfunction , hypogonadism, increased risk of Osteoporosis

Dermatological: Photosensitivity , skin rashes (e.g. chlorpromazine ; blue-grey discoloration in the sun)
Other: Lowering of the seizure threshold , hepatotoxicity , cholestatic jaundice , pancytopenia , agranulocytosis

Drugs in Psychiatry I,"<strong>Drugs in Psychiatry 1</strong><br /><br /><p>Antidepressants:
Classified according to MOA
All increase mono-amine neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft
There are 3 MOA NTNs: 1. 5-HT 2. NA 3. DA.

Antidepressants work in different ways to increase these in the synaptic cleft


3 main types of antidepressants:
1. TCAs
2. SSRIs
3.MAOIs

1. TCAs - 1st developed
Examples: Amitryptyline ; Clomiprimine
Action: Act on the presynaptic terminal by presynaptic blockade of NA and 5-HT re-uptake
Also: muscarinic ,histaminergic 
and alpha adrenergic blockade

Inidication:
Depression ; Anxiety disorders ; OCD ; Other : Chronic pain ,migraines and insomnia

Side effects:
Muscarinic: Dry mouth , blurred vision , urinary retention and constipation
Alpha-adrenergic : Postural hypotension ; Sexual dysfunction
Antihistaminergic: Weight gain , sedation
Cardiotoxic: Long QT , ST segment elevation , heart block , arrhythmia

Cautions:
Dangerous in overdose - so you must look at your patients suicidal risk
Contraindications : Recent MI , Arrhythmias, Heart Block , Severe liver disease , mania

SSRIs:
Examples: Fluoxetine , sertraline , citalopram , paroxetine

Action: Work on the presynaptic terminal - presynaptic blockade of 5-HT re-uptake

Indications:
NICE 1st line tx Depression & Anxiety disorders
OCD
Bulimia Nervosa ( Fluoxetine)

Side effects: Fewer than TCAs , hence often used as 1st line

Some imporatant S/E:
GI: Nausea , vomiting ,diarrhoea
Early anxiety (warn pt) and agitation - in the 1st few weeks
Loss of appetite ; weight change ; insomnia ; sweating ; sexual dysfunction (anorgasmia ; delayed ejaculation) ; Hyponatraemia

Cautions: CI = mania (can worsen mania - bipolar)

Serotonin syndrome
Epi: Rare but potentially fatal
Aet: SSRIs , TCAs, MAOIs , Amphetamines, Lithium 
Usually assoc with drug overdose and combination of drugs taken
PC: Altered mental state , tremor , agitation , shivering , diarrhoea, Neuro: hyper-reflexia , rigidity , myoclonus , ataxia , hyperthermia
Inv: Bloods ; drugs toxicology screen and ECG
Mx: Get SNR help immediately


MAOIs: 
Examples : Phenelzine
MOA: Non selective irreversible inhibition of mono-amine oxidase A &B . Mono-amine oxidase aims to breakdown monoamine NTNs therefore if this is broken down then you get an increase in the NTNs at the synaptic cleft.

Indications:
2nd line treatment in depression as a result of serious interactions with other drugs.

Tyramine crisis  = cheese reaction
Tyramine is catabolised by MOA-A. When inhibited these levels increase
S&S: Life threatening hypertensive crisis --> release of NA --> stroke or MI
Tyramine containing foods: Wines/ cheeses (mature) / meats (pickled herring , smoked fish)

Careful when prescribing as many interactions with other drugs e.g. cocaine , LA , cough mixtures/decongestants

Side effects: Weight gain , dry mouth , constipation , loss of libido , seizures 

Contra-indications:
Phaeochromocytoma ; CVD ; Hepatic impairment ; Mania



Mood stabilisers:
3 main  ones :
1. Lithium
2. Valproate
3. Carbamazapine

Lithium:
MOA: Uncertain - modulates NTN induced activation of 2nd messengers.
Gold standard tx of Bipolar Disorder esp long term treatment ( as proved as controlled double blind studies)

Indications:
Acute Mania
Prophylaxis of Bipolar disorder
Treatment resistant depression
Adjunct to antipsychotics --> schizoaffective disorder

Side effects:
Polyuria - ADH is antagonised and urine concentration is decreased
Weight gain 
Oedema
Fine tremor
Worsens skin problems - acne and psoriasis
Thirst
Hypothyroidism
Impaired renal function
T-wave flattening /inversion
Leucocytosis
Teratogenicity

Cautions:
Excreted by kidneys --> kidney damage --> clearance reduced and risk of toxicity increased.

Increase lithium levels:
NSAIDs ; ACEi ; Diuretics
Increased neurotoxicity with antipsychotics (Careful with co-prescribing)

Toxic levels:
0.5 - 1 mmol (narrow)
Toxic >1.5 mmol Dangerously >2 mmol

Toxicity: 
GI: Nausea , vomiting ; anorexia
Neuro: Coarse tremor , ataxia , muscle weakness, nystagmis, dysarthtia , impaired conciousness , hyperreflexia , convulsions , coma

Before starting pts on lithium check:
Bloods: FBCs , U&ES, TFTs 
Pregnancy test- discuss re suitable methods of contraception
ECG - baseline - can change ECG

Monitoring:
Blood levels monitored weekly until therapeutic level has been stable for 4 weeks.
After this:
Lithium levels : 3 monthly
Renal function and thyroid function: 6 monthly

ECT:
Seizures induced with electric stimulus whilst patient is under GA and given muscle relaxants
Indications: Severe episodes - rapid short term treatment
Severe depression with the following elements:
1. Fluid and food restriction
2. Strong suicidal intent
3. Psychotic features and stupor
4. Failure of drug treatment/ drug intolerance

Speed of action: Should act quickly vs antidepressant which take weeks to act

Other indications:
Schizophrenia
Catatonic stages
Postive psychotic symptoms
Schizoaffective disorder

Administered 2-3/weel
4-12 treatments
Short acting anaesthetic induction agent and muscle relaxant - 5 mins of anaesthesia
Psychiatrist applies 2 electrodes to patients scalp in bilateral or unilateral placement to give generalized seizure for 15 seconds

Side effects : Loss of short term memory; confusion ;  headache ; nausea ; muscle pains ; anaesthetic complications (Arrhythmias) , prolonged seizure

Assessment before ECT
Hx , Ex , Bloods , ECG & CXR

Interactions
CI: Heart disease ( Recent MI , heart failure, IHD)
Raised ICP

Hoarse Voice,"<strong>HOARSE VOICE/ DYPHONIA</strong><br /><br /><p>cardinal symptom of laryngeal disease

> longer than 3 weeks should be laryngeal carcinoma until proven otherwise as benign causes such as laryngitis usually clear up in <2 weeks. 

causes

acute laryngitis - usually viral as part of urti. 

chronic laryngitis - seen in smokers, drinkers and shouting a lot. 

laryngeal traumua - banging together of vocal cords causes oedema or sub mucosal heamtomas that later way the cords are joined together. may also occur with prolonged end intubation. nodules can occur due to prolonged use of the voice. larger ones need to be removed.



laryngeal nerve palsy - the intrinsic muscles of the larynx responsible for vocal cords movement. so if not working the phonation is disrupted. the nerve descends from its origin in nucleus ambiguous in the brain stem, through the jugular foramen then alongside the pharynx, then on the left side into the chest to pass around the ligamentum arteriosum. 

caused by - cerebral tumours, carcinoma of nasopharynx, thyroid carcinomas, malignancy in hilar lymph nodes, oesophagus. 

LARYNGEAL CARCINOMA

almost always in smokers. 

occurs in 3 sites: 70% are glottic or on vocal cords, 20% are supraglottic and 10% are subglottic. 

metastasis can cause resp obstruction, dysphasia and pain.

later metastasis occurs in the deep cervical lymph nodes.

these lesions tend to present early as little irregularity of the vocal cord causes hoarseness.

HYSTERICAL DYSPHONIA

young females often. 

causes- deep rooted psychological problem. 

NEWBORN

The Outer Ear,"<p>EAR WAX

normally moves along the canal laterally and is moved by skin epithelium in the same direction.

using cotton buds can cause impaction of wax so this should be discouraged and can cause canal irritation and dermatitis and otitis externa.

if the wax becomes stuck there is local discomfort and conductive deafness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;EXTERNAL EAR

heamatoma blood between perichondrium and cartilage which relies on blood supply around the ear. buildup can therefore disrupt blood causing fibrous scarring necrosis and lead to cauliflower ear. 

should be drained with a wide boar needle or excised. 
&nbsp;</p><p>OTITIS EXTERNA

acute or chronic

acute - boil in external auditory meatus in outer 1/3 as this is only place containing hair follies.

presents with pain worse on eating or movement of temporomandibular joint and is relieved by bursting the boil. 

treatment - glycerol and icthemol (antiseptic) wicks. spreading celutlitis should be treated with antibiotics. 

chronic - (hong kong ear)

itching and intermittent discharge and is also painless. 

treatment - antibiotic and steroid ear drop (gentazone: gentamicin and hydrocortisone). aluminium acetate for pseudomonas and nistatin for fungal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;OTITIS EXTERNA HAEMORHAGICA/ BULLOUS MYRENGITIS 

painful blood blisters on EAM and eardrum and when rupture blood can emerge at ear entrance. 

treatment - analgesia and reassurance as usually gets better over weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;HERPES SIMPLEX/ SHINGLES/ RAMSEY HUNT

hsv has laid dormant in geniculate ganglion and when immunocompromised the virus migrates along sensory fibres causing a vesicular ruption in the eam and pinna.

The Nose,"<p>anatomy/physiology

breathing - moistens/warms/traps particles

3 conchi/turbinates - lined by pseudo stratified ciliated columnar epithelium, goblet and submucus glands which secrete mucus for trapping particles.

superior, middle and inferior

airway

smell - occurs mainly in upper 1/3, up the lumens and dissolve on the yellowish olfactory epithelium there. 

sinuses - cavity in the bones of face which connects to the nasal cavity. unsure of function (possibly resonance). 

maxilliary, ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid.

maxillary, frontal and anterior ethmoidal sinuses drain into the middle meatus.
posterior ethmoidal drains into the superior meatus.

maxillary drainage is difficult due to the angle of drainage lying high on the medial wall meaning it is poor and means sinusitis is likely. 

NOSE BLEED

source: in young children is often in the littles area from the anterior ethmoidal artery based just inside the nose on the septum and is due to picking. treatment is with pressing on area and siting forward. if recurrent then cautery with silver nitrate can be used. 

in adults bleeding may also occur in littles area though is usually due to mild trauma to muco-cutaneous vein.

in elderly source is high up (sphenopalantine artery) and far back so vasoconstriction should be promoted, which can be tricky due to often co-existent atherosclerosis, so sit forward and pack with ice. if not see ENT then possible insertion of simpson's balloon. 

TRAUMA

soft tissue injury

displacement of nasal septum

heamtoma of nasal septum - collection of blood between septal cartilage and perichondrium which obstructs blood supply which can result in necrosis, fibrosis and flat nose or saddling. visualised as body swelling and always requires draining.

fractures - flattened or lateral deviated. 

management

should be done immediately if possible if not wait for 7-10 days for swelling to go down then surgery.

DEVIATED NASAL SEPTUM

the septum is over curved resulting in nasal blockage which is usually bilateral as there is compensatory swelling of the turbinates on the contralateral side. if problems an SMR (sub-muscosal resection of the nasal septum) can be performed.

CATARRH

excess production of mucus usually caused by increase in tissue fluid leading to flooding of mucus membranes and swelling.

may be allergic or vasomotor

allergic = mass cell degranulation with histamine release and vasodilation and increased  vascular permeability. suspect if all year, association with allergens or history of atopy.

vasomotor = arteriolar end of capillary which supply the nose and therefore supply of blood. anything causing reduced sympathetic tone or increased parasympathetic tone can lead to increased hydrostatic pressure and increased tissue fluid loss, leading to catarrh symptoms. i.e anti-hypertensives, emotional factors, temp and hormones. 

treatment = desensitisation therapy, vasoconstrictors, steroid cream or perhaps surgery (turbinate cautery- blood supply cut leading to less fluid).

POLYPS

swollen areas of mucus membrane which occur in sinus which prolapse into nose. seen as grey-yellow mass and are distinguished from swollen turbinate as are anaesthetic wheres turbinates when touched cause pain.

treated with polypectomy

anterochoanal polyp - single unilateral polyp arising from maxillary sinus. causes unilateral blockage. surgery used to remove. 

COMMON SINUS PROBLEMS

ACUTE SINUSITIS - usually due to acute urti causing oedema which blocks the sinus ostium. there is a viral effusion which provides a growth medium for further infection. maxillary sinus is most common due to difficulty in drainage. 

constitutional upset, cheek pain, ipsilateral nasal blockage and a purulent nasal discharge (if smelly indicates anaerobic bacteria but could be a sign of a tooth abcess which has ruptures upwards into the sinus). 

treatment with fluid, bed rest and analgesia. 
ephedrine with saline. 
amoxicilline. 

if failed a sinus wash can be used.

ETHMOIDITIS (most common in childhood)

important to recognise as spread may occur through the lamina papricia and result in orbital inflammation. 

usually treated with decongestants and antibiotics though abcess formation can result in problems such as proptosis, kemosis, opthalmoplegia and oedema treated with drainage. 

FRONTAL SINUSITIS

acute pain and tenderness over frontal area.
treated with antibiotics and decongestants.

rare complications include posterior spread and formation of subdural abcess and meningitis.

CHRONIC SINUSITIS

repeat episodes of acute sinusitis
more common in smokers, dusty workers and in association with bronchiecstasis and chronic otitis media.

purulent discharge with onosmia and sinus xrays show opacities. 

treatment - drainage with washing out sinuses and create new pathways for fluids to drain OR proliferative where fill in the sinus tissue with fat (cold well luke procedure).

NEOPLASMS

fairly uncommon

benign - squamous papillomas: simple warts in nose, transitional cell papillomas: frontal tumours which are locally invasive, juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas usually occur in nasophaynx of young boys and present with extreme bleeding and blockage and require excision and radiotherapy. 

malignant - squamous cell carcinoma of ethmoid and maxillary and adenocarciomas in lea the workers and should be suspected in unilateral polyp like lesion. spread may cause orbital symptoms i.e diplopia. 

carcinoma of nasophaynx in association with EBV. 

DISORDERS OF SMELL

anosmia - complete loss
hyposmia - partial loss
cachosmia - foul smelling
parosmia - altered sensations

may be due to local nasal disease or olfactory nerve disease

local - obstruction, swelling of turbinates, polyps, tumours often cause hyposmia as problems with smells reaching upper 1/3 of nose.

olfactory - anosmia i.e. skull fractures, tumours i.e. meningiomas of anterior cranial fossa and viral olfactory neuritis.</p><strong></strong><br /><br />",8283,19,,2012-12-31 15:57:29 UTC,2012-12-31 19:16:06 UTC
Respiratory System Overview,"<strong>Respiratory System Overview</strong><br /><br /><p>28 days gestation - lungs develop
Endoderm

*RDS and Surfactant deficiency if premature

5 stages of development
1. Embryonic up to wk 7 
2. Pseudoglandular phase 7-14 weeks
3. Canalicular Phase weeks 17-27 - epithelium of type 1+2(surfactant) pneumocytes
4. Saccular weeks 28-36 (if prem - poorly developed alveoli as this stage has not occurred!)
5. Alveolar phase - alveoli multiply to 30-50% adult number

Postnatal lung change - increase alveoli, lung growth.

NEWBORN infants - abdominal breathing pattern as IC muscles are weaker than diaphragm.
Infants are nose breathers as opposed to mouth breathers and thus become short of breath even from a simple blocked nose from a cold.

Tidal volume - volume of air inspired & expired during normal breathing
Residual volume - volume of air remaining in the lungs after max expiration
TLC - volume in lungs after max inspiration (IRV +TV + ERV + RV)
Vital capacity - volume of air that can be exhaled after a max inspiration (IRV + TV +ERV)

Lung FTs
- Spirometry >5 years old. Volume of gas expired and flow rate is recorded
Normal FEV1:FVC ratio is 75-80%

Obstructive lung disease - airflow limitation e.g. CF, asthma (TLC normal or increased)
Restrictive lung disease - diminished lung volumes (TLC is reduced)

Heart Failure,"<p>Heart failure is a clinical syndrome caused by an abnormality of the heart with characteristic signs and symptoms - breathlessness, fatigue, fluid retention.

3 types really - acute, cardiogenic shock, chronic

5 general causes of heart failure:
arrythmias
myocardial disease (coronary ischaemia, hypertrophy due to HT, cardiomyopathy)
pericardial disease
valvular disease
congenital heart disease

Symptoms:
Dyspnoea
Fatigue
Angina
Syncope
Palpitations

Signs:
Tachycardia
Weak character to pulse
Cachexic
Oedema
Hepatomegally
Bibasal crackles

Ix:
ECG
CXR
ECHO
Haematology
Biochemistry
BNP

Rx:
Acute heart failure (treatment objectives are to reduce the R atrial pressure and to offload fluid)
Sit the patient up
Administer oxygen
Frusemide (40mg) OVER 10 MINS TO PREVENT OTOTOXICITY
Morphine 2-5mg w/ antiemetic
IV or oral nitrates

Chronic heart failure
Lifestyle advice (stop smoking, reduce lipid and salt intake)
Thiazide diuretics
Loop diuretics - frusemide
K+ sparing diuretics

Postpartum Haemorrhage,"<p>PPH 
3rd highest direct cause of death after PE and pre-eclampsia. It is preventative; if its happens, there are Tx available. Multi-disciplinary team mgt. 

What is it? PPH can be divided into primary and secondary 
 Primary = >500ml of blood loss in the first 24hrs. </p><p>Secondary PPH - abnormal bleeding from 24hrs after delivery to 12 weeks post delivery. </p><p>Midwives are trained to determined the amount of blood loss; and if it is clotting. Its very important in cases of moderate to severe to determine amount of blood loss so as to determine resuscitation volume</p><p>Causes: 4 T's 

Tone (e.g. uterine atony): this is the actual tone of the uterus, whats important is the when you're post delivery ---> increase in hormone oxytocin causes contraction. The effect of contraction of the myometrium is to compress the intermyometrial blood vessels which stops the bleeding. if there is no contraction then you get continuous bleeding
'Key risk factor' = multiple gestation</p><p>2nd T: Tissue (Placental Retention)

A retained placenta causes alteration of the structure of the uterus which stops it from contracting properly. 
- May be due to conditions such as placenta accreta, percreta, and increta
</p><strong>Trauma</strong><br /><br /><p>(Not most common cause of PPHs) 
Cervical, vaginal laceration, medio-lateral episiotomy often done in instrumental deliveries. These can cause hidden haematomas. 
So in this case the woman is shocked but you don't see the bleeding. </p><strong>Thrombin</strong><br /><br />",8176,20,85,2012-12-31 15:57:06 UTC,2012-12-31 15:57:06 UTC

Anaemia,"<strong>Megaloblastic Anaemia</strong><br /><br /><p>macrocystosis -
   - megaloblastic- b12/folate deficiency- nuclear maturation delayed
  -non-megaloblastic- maturation not delayed

Megaloblastic: absence of vit b12 and folate leads to reduced cell output + abnormal cells

All cell lines affected: Red cells- macrocytosis; neutrophils- hypersegmented; platelets - thrombocytopenia

Vitamin b12 deficiency: 
Absorption: stomach binds to intrinsic factor produced by parietal cells- complex then absorbed by terminal ileum 
Causes: reduced intake (uncommon. vegans); impaired absorption (stomach or ileum)

Pernicious anaemia most common cause of vitb12 deficiency
Autoimmune attack on parietal cells---> atrophic gastritis and lack of intrinsic factor. reduced absorption in terminal ileum 
Reduced serum vit b12 and autoantiboides: antiparieal cell and anti-if
Associations: other autoimmune diseases such as thyroid and addison's, gastric adenocarcinoma- predisposition 

Clinical features:

Anaemia
Specific: peripheral neuropathy - glove and stocking and subacute combined degenration  (posterior and lateral columns)- loss of vibration, propriorecption. weightloss, optic atrophy and dementia.

Treatment: 
Hydroxycobalamin - im injections , no oral formulation

should ALWAYS be given with folate! start on folate without b12 and undelrying deficiency of b12 can precipitate neurological complications

Folate deficiency 

1. dietary factors ( reduced intak- more common than vit12 )  good sources spinach, brocooli, liver 
2. malabsoprtion e.g crohn's
3. increased dd e.g pregnancy, meyloproliferation, haemolysis 
3. Drugs e.g methotrexate, alcohol, anti-convulsants 

Key diagnostic test:
red cell folate reduced

Treatment: 
oral folate
remember vit b12

1. Reduced production: bone marrow probs, AofCD, haematinic deficiency (Fe, B12, folate)
2. Reduced life span: haemolysis
3. Pooling: splenomegaly</p><strong>Iron DA</strong><br /><br /><p>Causes:
1. Reduced intake
2. Increased demand (e.g. pregnancy, childhood)
3. Malabsorbtion e.g. coeliacs
4. Chronic blood loss - most common. NB: Upper GI loss is 3x more common than lower GI blood loss</p><p>Findings on FBC: decreased Hb, MCV (<80fl), and ferritin but increased serum iron/TIBC</p><p>Findings on FBC: decreased Hb, MCV (<80fl), and ferritin but increased serum iron/TIBC.

STEMI - preferably some type of Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention i.e. angioplasty, stent. If not available then thrombolysis. Can be done u to 12 hours post onset of pain - remember to ask when pain started in Hx.

NSTEMI - admit to acute care (preferably cardiac ward), monitoring (NSTEMI can progree to STEMI). No PPCI. 2 goals of Tx:
1. Stop thrombosis - Aspirin, clopidogrel, anticoagulate (LMWH) and statin.

A: Group A strep and staph aureus most common. H Infuenzae: Facial cellulitis in kids/ipsilateral otitis media
Hx: of trauma or background of risk factors. 
S: fever, myalgia, fatigue
Si: local pain, swelling, erythema. PROGRESSIVE disease, localised lymphadenopathy

DD:
1. Erysipelas: A: Strep, P: Dermis and HYPOdermis Si: bridge of nose and face (elderly people), Raised edge and distinct margin. (THIS distinguished cellulitis and erysipelas)
2. Impetigo: A: Staph toxins which cleave the upper epidermal area. Si: ""Golden crusting"", vesicles-> pustules-> then golden crust. often seen in eczema patients therefore they have previous staph infections. 

other differential diagnoses:
3. Varicose eczema - bilateral (cellulitis not usually)
4. Deep vein thrombosis - no erythema (but yes in cellulitis)

Differentiating Under microscope:
Strep: Strips and catalase negative. 
Staph: Clusters and catalase positive.

Group A Strep (pyogenes): strep pharyngitis, scarlet fever, strep skin reaction, strep toxic shock syndrome. 
Group B strep: B for BABY! meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia
Group D strep: Enterococci (normal bowel flora) - UTI, biliary tract inf
Strep Pneumonia: Most common cause of meningitis in adults, most common cause of otitis media in children. Must vaccinate immunocompromised patients with pneumovax. e.g no spleen, retroviral disease.
VIridans Group Strep: Dental inf, Abscess (brain and abdomen)


Staph:

Exotoxin Release: Scalded skin syndrome, Gastroenteritis (most imp to cause onset of vomiting within 24 hours), toxic shock syndrome
Direct Invasion: Skin infection (v common in eczema patients - mixed staph and strep inf called impetigo) , acute bacterial endocarditis (nasty one) , osteomyelitis (young kids <12), pneumonia (nasty one - empyema), meningitis, septic arthritis. 

Toxic Shock: classic with lost tampon - TSST 1
Diffuse erythematous rash
Fever
D&V
Desquamation of palms and soles
Septic Shock

Scalded Skin Syndrome:
Production of exfoliation toxic! 
      Neonates
      Cleavage of middle dermis - skin peals off 
      Healing - rapid

Acute Endocarditis:
Fevers, that are high enough to cause myalgia, rigors, chills, very severe headaches. 
most develop it on a background of valve destruction. most commonly by strep which gains access through trivial wound or dental procedure. some people no hx of valvular disease (IV users that get staph inf on the right sided valves. Why right sided valves? they inject drugs into veins). if its caused by strep: more gradual or insidious onset compared to the one of staph

Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs,"<p>Anti-arrhythmic drugs
Class 1 - Na blockers
-1a (hardly used) - slow conduction and prolong repolarisation (Quinidine, Disopyramide)
-1b slows conduction and shortens repolarisation (V only) (lignicaine)
-1c clows conduction and doesn't affect repolarisation (flecainide)
Class 2 - b-blocker - slows AV conduction through reduction of Ca2+ antry into AV node (A, SAN, AVN, V)
Class 3 - K+ channel effects - throughout heart (amiodarone)
Class 4 - Ca2+ blocker - both SAN and AVN, verapamil, diltiazem

Flecainide - not good if LV dysfunction (increases risk of sudden cardiac death) - use as chemical cardiverter for AF

Amiodarone
-kills all known arrhythmias
-heavily bound to tissues, irritant, very fat soluble
-needs loading dose
-Thyroid dysfunction, pulmonary fibrosis, slate grey appearance to skin, corneal deposits
-Can be used in cardiac disease (unlike flecainide)

Dihydropyridines - non-rate limiting
Non-dihydropyridines - rate limiting

Amenorrhoea,"<p>Amenorrhoea
primary
-failure of menarche by 16
-failure of secondary sexual characteristics by 14

secondary
-cessation of menses for >6 months in pre-menopausal women

Causes:
primary
-mullerian agenesis (no uterus), outflow tract obstruction (imperforate hymen etc), constitutional delay of puberty, gonadal dysgenesis (related to turner's sometimes)
Secondary
-pregnancy, hypothalamic amenorrhoea, hyperprolactinoma, premature ovarian failure, hypothyroidism, outflw tract obstruction (fibroids and polyps)

Hormonal sub-types:
-hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (failure of GnRH secretion)
-hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism (GnRH release, FSH/LH release, failure of eggs - premature ovarian failure)
-normogonadotrophic (hormones are all normal)
-hyperprolactinaemia (increase in prolactin, not enough dopamine)

Take history 90% of diagnosis is on this alone
-Age, age of menarche, have you previously achieved normal menstruation, duration of symptoms, ?sexually active (chance of pregnancy), contraceptive history
-Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism
--exercise, eating habits, stress, medical causes (IBD etc), hypo/hyperthyroid, SOL in brain, liver/renal disease, anosmia?, recent delivery (post-partum inferction of the pituitary [sheehan's])
-Hypergonadotrophic hypogonadotrophic
--congenital abnormalities, vasomotor symptoms (early menopause)
-normogonadotrophic
--Endocrine history (cushings, acromegaly etc), PCOS, recent endometrial trauma (asherman's syndrome), virilization, cyclical abdominal pain (outflow tract)
-Hyperprolactinoma
--Ask about galactorrhoea, headache, visual symptoms
--drug history - anti-psychotics, anti-dopaminergics, histamine blockers


Examination
-hypo-hypo - signs of an eating disorder (lanugo, caries, enlarged parotids), absence of secondary sexual characteristics, signs of IBD (clubbing, erythema nodosum), liver and renal disease (jaundice, dialysis lines)
-Hyper-hypo - Turner's syndrome (web neck, short stature) vasomotor symptoms, atrophic vaginitis, thin, dry skin
-normo - Hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, cushing's, virilization, PV exam for causes of outflow tract obstruction
-Hyperprolactinoma - bitemporal hemianopia, galactorrhoea

Investigations
-bHCG (not always accurate if recent conception)
-Gonadotrophins and oestrodiol
--LOW FSH/LH and oestradiol = hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism
--High FSH/LH and low oestradiol = hypergonadotrophic hyopgonadism

Menstrual Cycle,"<p>Hormonal changes in puberty
- Gonadotrophin levels remain low
- Near puberty GnRH is released from the hypothalamus
- pulsed and increasing in amplitude
- release of LH and FSH (GnRH has to be pulsatile)

Phases of the menstrual cycle
FSH - stimulates oocytes, increases LH receptors
LH -acts on thecal cells of ovary - androgens produced (converted to oestrogens)

Day 1 = first day of bleeding
lasts 4 days
1-8 = follicular phase (increasing LH and FSH, causing gradual oestrogen increase. Not fixed, changes in hormone etc affect it)
6-13 = proliferative phase (thickening endometrium due to oestrogen, also negative feedback to LH/FSH)
~14 = massive LH/FSH surge due to acute positive feedback of oestrogen causing ovulation.
14-29 = luteal phase (formation of corpus luteum - this is the fixed phase of the cycle)

if no fertilisation:
-corpus luteum degenerates -> less progesterone/oestrogen -> endometrial shedding
-if fertilisation occurs corpus luteum is maintained by trophoblast

Endometrium:
Affected in disease:
1. Damage to ovary - no development of eggs
2. Disruption of hormone levels

Pleural Effusions,"<p>Pleural Effusions
Clinical Guidelines
Definition
-Abnormal fluid in the pleura
Causes:
-tranudates (oncotic pressure problems): LVF, cirrhosis, hypoalbuminaemia, peritoneal dialysis, hypothyroid, nephrotic syndrome, mitral stenosis
-Exudates (permeability of the vasculature is altered [inflammation, malignancy], protein high):  Malignancy, Parapneumonic effusions (most often strep pneumiae), Tuberculosis, PE, RA, benign asbestos effusion, pancreatitis, MI, post CABG, drugs (anything causing fibrosis)

Empyema - collections of pus within existing cavity
Lung abscess - collection of pub which occurs within an unnatural body cavity

Features:
on examination:
-look for decreased chest expansion on affected side, scars, tracheal deviation away (may need drain), reduced tactile vocal fremitus, stony dull, reduced breath sounds, crackles, decreased vocal resonance, pleural rub
look for cause!- scarring, oedema, JVP, signs of malignancy, liver disease

Diagnostic algorithm:
if clinically transudative treat suspected cause
if trial fails, pleural aspiration to define biochemical nature guide with USS
CXR - costophrenic blunting, CT, 
USS for septations

Septations;
-infection, malignancy
-difficult to drain due to loculations.

Tests for pleural effusions:
-Biochemistry - LDH and protein
-Microbiology - microscopy and culture (TB, parapneumonic effusion)
-Cytology- differential cell count (malignancy)
-Not always diagnostic
-others: pH (acidotic can mean empyema), AAFB and TB culture, Triglycerides, cholesterol, amylase (pancreatitis related), haematocrit (traumatic tap, previous tap, malignancy), glucose (low in RA, TB, infection)

Too much protein = problem with permeability (>30g) - exudate
Normal protein = transudate (<30g),
If blood protein abnormal or pleural protein ~ 30 use light's criteria

Light's criteria, any of the following = exudate:
1. pleural protein/serum protein >0.5
2. Pleural LDH/Serum LDH > 0.6
3. Pleural LDH >2/3 upper limit of normal for serum LDH


Treatment is dependent on cause, pleural aspiration, refer to chest physician, light's criteria, assume cause form examination. can do contrast- enhanced CT thorax
-If transudate try treating cause
-If no diagnosis do contrast enhanced CT thorax - try to decide whether to leave fluid in or not.

Hypertension,"<p>Hypertension! WOOP!!!!!

a blood pressure at which the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk.
Hypertension greatly increases risk of vascular disease

REMEMBER 140/90!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Primary (essential) - idiopathic - 95%

Secondary (particularly important in pts presenting young with very high blood pressures:
-renal disease
-endocrine disease (cushing's, conn's, phaeochromocytoma, hyperthroid)
-pregnancy (aargh pre-eclampsia)
-drugs ('roids etc.) or lack of anti-hypertensives concordance

Assess for secondary cause
-renal disease (urine [protein, haem], bloods [U&Es], USS)
-endocrine (cushing's [urinary free cortisol], conn's [renin and aldosterone], phaeo [urinary VMA])

Risks
-99% asymptomatic 
-atheromatous disease
-cerebral haemorrhage
-eye disease
-kidney disease

What blood pressure?
160/100
140/90 - treat depending on risk
don't treat on a one-off, ideally do ambulatory BP

CVS 10 year risk > 20% = treat
Existing vascular disease
Target organ damage

Management
conservative
-weight reduction
-diet
-smoking
-low salt
-exercise
-reduce alcohol

Management: physio, active, analgesia should heal by itself
If persistent or reoccuring then considered discectomy + spondylodesis </p><p>Spinal Stenosis: decreased in diameter of the intervertebral foramina
Causes: Spondylolisthesis, OA, prolapse, pagets disease
Symptoms: Lower back pain progressively worse over time + spinal (neurogenic) claudication ( induced by exercise or standing straight and relieved by sitting or bending forwards)

Basic Arrhythmias,"<p>Pulse: Irregularly irregular
ECG: Loss of P waves, fine fibrillating base line

Causes:
CARDIAC - ischaemic heart disease, (mitral) valve disease
NON-CARDIAC - alcohol, thyrotoxicosis, pneumonia

Complications:
 - reduced CO (most ventricle filling is passive, 15% is active and some patients cant cope with this)
 - embolic stroke risk
 - fast ventricular response(increased O2 demand)

Management:
 - Rate control - use a drug to control ventricular response however continual AF gives rise to a risk of clot formation therefore need anti-coagulation.  Drugs = BB, CCB and Digoxin
 - Rhythm control - cures the fibrillation therefore does not require anti-coagulation.Use DC shock, drugs(amiodarone)

Diverticulitis and IBD,"<p>Appendicitis
- inflammation of the vermiform appendix (worm- like cos it dangles)
- Severity varies from mild oedema of the appendix to necrosis and perforation or peritonitis (Abx cover?)

Epidemiology
Very common (12%); Can occur at any age, but rarely <2 due to extra space around appendix during development, but peaks in childhood

Pathology: 2 main ways
1. Obstruction - Poo impacted at the neck of the appendix/ rarely caused by worms
2. Lymphoid hyperplasia - with an infection the lymph glands enlarge and block the wall
Complications --> perforation
Localised - appendix mass
Generalised - peritonitis

Clinical features:
General: Pyrexia, malaise and anorexia
Specific: CENTRAL COLICKY ABDO PAIN then vomiting 
then pain moves to localised RIF (McBurny's point)
also associated with constipation (usual), but also diarrhoea

O/E - General: still, flexed hips and knees (retrocaecal)/ systemic signs: pyrexia, tachycardia, fetor oris + coated tongue (smell of vomit from tongue)

Abdomen: LOCALISED: guarding and rebound GENERALISED: rigid and tender all over, ileus (bowel shock - absent bowel sounds)

Looking for appendicitis:
McBurney's point: 2/3 distance between umbilicus and ASIS

DDX: important in women (pregnant test in all female ptx) - ectopic? pelvic inflammatory disease? Ovarian cyst rupture?
GI - mesenteric adenitis (in children)/ diverticular disease/ Meckel's/ IBD/ Caecal carcinoma/ perforated PU
Renal- UTI/ colic

Ix: Culture: urine + dipstix + HCG (in all women)
Bloods: FBC (neutrophil/ WCC raised?), CRP
Imaging: U/S - exclude gynae cause, appendix inflammation (free fluid, diameter >6mm)
CT for atypical
Scopic - laparoscopy (typically with women with no cause found on US)

Mx
Conservative - ""active observation""
-Nil by mouth, analgesia, fluids
Medical
- Cefuroxime and metronidazole
Surgical
-OPEN: different scars (LANZ - more horzontal & McBurney/ Grid- Iron - oblique)
-LAPAROSCOPIC - most done like this - good for girls :look for insertion points

3 important complications

a) Hyperkalaemia: protect myocardium from effect of K+with calcium gluconate, then remove K+ with insulin and dextrose (puts K+ into cells)
b) Pulmonary oedema:
c) Acidosis: Go and find a renal physician! SOMETIMES bicarbonate, dialysis if refractory.

a) PRE-RENAL: FLUIDS - because most common cause is pre-renal, and most common cause of pre-renal is hypoperfusion
b) RENAL: Immunosuppression (usually steroids) because most are inappropriate immune response
c) POST-RENAL: relieve obstruction (e.g. catheter through enlarged prostate) or perform nephrostomy (e.g. large stone - put a tube through above the obstruction)

VERY accelerated atherogenesis: most people die of a heart attack, stroke etc. Probably statins most effective treatment.

Altered taste perception

Reduced absorption of calcium (final hydroxylation of calcitriol) - results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy and bone cysts.

3 most common causes in men- BPH, malignant prostate disease and urethral strictures. Local causes - luminal, wall based or extra luminal- 
Local luminal causes- clot, stone,
wall based- strcitures
extra-luminal- BPH, prostate cancer, constipation,  other pelvic masses fibroids and ovarian mass. 
general casues- Post opertive!! anaesthtic drugs, pelvic surgery, NEURLOGICAL causes such as stroke. UMN causes chronic renetion with reflex incontince, LMN causes chronic rentention with overflow incontinence. other causes include post stroke, MS and acutely cauda equina syndrome. finally drugs such as anticholinergic and antihitamines and antipyscotics, oral decongestants incraseing alpha adrenergic tone.

reduced production - either insufficient (fe, b12, folate def) or inefficient (bone marrow infiltration)

insufficient - Fe def anaemia: 1mg for men and 2 mg for menstruating women RDA, iron stored in red cells and liver. can be reduced intake (malnut), increased deman (pregnancy), malabsorption (coeliac), blood loss.

blood loss - very little blood loss can give massive loss of iron. e.g. menstruation and gi tract (usually upoer gi tract). Hb will be low, MCV low <80, ferritin (iron store) can be low but if acute phase (inflam or malignancy) then it may be raised, serum iron and total iron biding capacity (low and high). blood film: small rbc, hypochromic (central pallor), variable size and shape. Fe anaemia is not diagnosis so investigate further. find source and treat (e.g. upper gi bleed). Rx with ferrous sulphate (s.e abd pain, constip) if poor tolerance - IV iron or blood tranfusion.</p><p>megaloblastic anaemia - components arent there for DNA so cell continues to make loads of proteins leads to  large cel volume. can be non-megaloblastic macrocytosis.
B12 and folate needed for maturation, absence leads to reduced cell output as they cant get out of bone marrow - some can. not only RBC other cells too - neutrophils (hypersegmented and can be reduced number - leucopenia) and also thrombocytopenia. 
B12 def: b12 in stomach binds to intrinsic factor (made by parietal clls) then this complex of b12 and IF goe to terminal ileum and is absorbed. can get b12 def red intake (rare, vegans). more common is impaired absorption in either tomach (post gastrectomy e.g.) or ileum (crohns, resection, pernicious anaemia).

Pernicious anaemia: autoimmne on parietal cell - atrophpic inflam in stomach so lack of IF produced - no b12 and IF complexes - lack of absorpotion. common to these pateitns are other auto immune diseases. 

B12 clin feat - of anaemia but specifically peripheral neuropathy. can lead to subacute combined degeneration (loss of vibration sense and ataxia). Rx - hydroxycobalamin (essentially b12) but has to be IM. always give with folate.

If a naÃ¯ve B cell from bone marrow encounters an antigen, it migrates to a lymphoid follicle and goes through a number of changes before developing into a plasma cell. Malignant change is very common and each of these cell stages can become malignant:
NaÃ¯ve B cell â Small lymphocytic lymphoma (low grade lymphoma)Â 
Mantle cell â Mantle cell lymphoma (high grade lymphoma)Â 
Centroblast â Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (high grade lymphoma)Â 
Centrocyte â Follicular lymphoma (low grade lymphoma)Â 
Marginal â Marginal zone lymphoma (low grade lymphoma)
The Epstein-Barr virus is commonly associated with both endemic and sporadic Burkittâs lymphoma (BL). HIV infection is linked with the immunodeficiency form of BL.
BL is a high grade B cell lymphoma, commonly affecting children, although can also occur in adults. It is staged using the Ann Arbor classification.
Human papilloma virus is associated with cervical cancer.Â 
Hepatitis B and C viruses are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.Â 
Human T-lymphotropic virus is associated with adult T cell leukaemia.
Reed-Sternberg cells are large binucleate cells, each with prominent nucleoli, giving an âowl eyeâ appearance on histology. They can also be multinucleated and there are a number of known variants.
Neutrophils are single nucleated, multi-lobed cells.Â 
Eosinophils are large bi-lobed, single nucleated cells.Â 
Erythrocytes (RBCs) are biconcaved, non-nucleated cells.Â 
Monocytes are large cells with a kidney shaped nucleus

Classical lymphoma accounts for 95% of Hodgkinâs lymphoma, whereas the nodular lymphocytic variant accounts for 5%.Â 
Classical nodular sclerosing lymphoma tends to affect younger people with mediastinal rather than peripheral involvement.Â 
Classical mixed cellularity lymphoma tends to affect older people with peripheral more than mediastinal involvement.

The B symptoms of lymphoma are the systemic symptoms of fever (>38 degrees centigrade), drenching sweats (most commonly at night) and weight loss (> 10% of normal body weight over a period of 6 months or less). They are associated with both Hodgkinâs and Non-Hodgkinâs lymphoma. The presence of B symptoms affects patient prognosis and therefore is included in the Ann-Arbor staging of lymphomas.

A 32-year-old female presents with a 2 week history of sore throat and fever followed by 4 weeks of malaise. On examination she has generalised tender lymphadenopathy. Histology of a cervical lymph node biopsy reveals prominent germinal centres in follicles with a diffuse polyclonal hyperplasia of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages.
Which is the most probable diagnosis?
This patient presents with a case of infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever and caused by Epstein-Barr virus. The virus has an incubation period of four to seven weeks and symptoms usually persist for 2-3 weeks, however the fatigue often lasts longer.

Burkitt's lymphoma is a high grade lymphoma, along with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma.
Small lymphocytic, follicular, marginal zone and MALT lymphomas are generally low grade.

Bleeding Disorders,"<p>Risk factors for DVT:
- AgeÂ 
- ThrombophiliaÂ 
- ObesityÂ 
- SmokingÂ 
- ImmobilityÂ 
- PregnancyÂ 
- OestrogensÂ 
- Malignancy
In von Willebrand's disease, the primary problem lies in the quantity or quality of von Willebrand factor. Von Willebrand factor has three main functions:
1. Binding of exposed subendothelium and plateletsÂ 
2. Binding of plateletsÂ 
3. Binding and stabilisation of FVIII in the circulation
The bleeding time will therefore be prolonged. In Type III von Willebrand's disease, the APTT will be prolonged and the Factor VIIIC will be decreased.
Anticoagulation factors include:
- Protein CÂ 
- Protein SÂ 
- Antithrombin IIIÂ 
- Tissue factor pathway inhibitor
HMWK is high molecular weight kininogen, which forms a complex with collagen in the intrinsic pathway.
There are 5 important procoagulant mutations:
1. Factor V LeidenÂ 
2. Protein C deficiencyÂ 
3. Protein S deficiencyÂ 
4. Antithrombin deficiencyÂ 
5. Prothrombin mutation
Of these, Factor V Leiden is the most commonly found mutation, affecting around 5% of Caucasians. It is an autosomal dominant disorder which causes protein C resistance.

Anaemia,"<p>A low reticulocyte count and a low haemoglobin suggest marrow aplasia. This is commonly seen in patients with sickle cell disease and parvovirus infection.

Beta thalassemia presents in sufferers over the age of 6 months, when the switch from gamma to beta chain production occurs and thus adult haemoglobin instead of fetal haemoglobin is produced. (Adult HbA is composed of 2 alpha and 2 beta chains, whereas fetal HbF is composed of 2 alpha and 2 gamma chains.)
Note that patients with severe alpha thalassemia will therefore present at birth.
Iron deficiency anaemia is MICROCYTIC (MCV < 80 fL)
Other important indices:
- Low ferritinÂ 
- Increased total iron binding capacityÂ 
- Reduced serum ironÂ 
- Transferrin saturation > 19%
Myelodysplasia is a mild malignancy of early myeloid progenitor cells. It is most common in the elderly and often an incidental finding on a blood film.
There is both a quantitative and a qualitative reduction in cell line function.
The risk of blastic transformation is around 30% (AML).
Spherocytosis is an inherited haemolytic anaemia with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.
Diagnosis requires an osmotic fragility test.
Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the terminal ileum, having bound with intrinsic factor (produced by the parietal cells of the gastric mucosa). The pancreas also plays a role by producing proteases that cleave the R-binders of the molecule.
This is important to know, as the causes of Vitamin B12 deficiency include:
- Loss of intrinsic factor (pernicious anaemia, gastrectomy)Â 
- Pancreatic insufficiencyÂ 
- Terminal ileal diseaseÂ 
- Bacterial overgrowth (over-utilisation of B12 by gut bacteria)
The most important signs associated with IDA are koilonychia, angular stomatitis, glosso-pharyngeal webbing and a smooth tongue.
Peripheral neuropathy may occur in association with anaemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency



Features of beta thalassaemia trait:
- Anaemia Hb > 9 g/dLÂ 
- Decreased MCV < 75fLÂ 
- Decreased MCHÂ 
- Raised HbA2 > 3.5 % (most accurate in distinguishing from IDA)Â 
- Raised HbF (slight)
Diagnostic findings in pernicious anaemia:
- Macryocytic anaemiaÂ 
- Low serum vitamin B12Â 
- Anti-parietal cell antibodies (in 90%)Â 
- Anti-IF antibodies (in 50%)
Schilling's Test used to be carried out but it is no longer available in the UK.
This patient has an iron deficiency anaemia (low Hb and low MCV).
In males of this age with IDA and normal gastroscopy, the possibility of colorectal carcinoma should be considered.
A picture of normocytic anaemia + raised ferritin suggests an anaemia of chronic disease.
Remember that ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and will therefore be increased by inflammatory/neoplastic processes.
The most common cause of iron deficiency is BLOOD LOSS.
General causes of IDA:
Reduced intakeÂ 
- Increased demand (growth/pregnancy)Â 
- Malabsorption (post-gastrectomy)Â 
- Blood loss (menstruation, GI loss, hookworms)

Precipitants of oxidative crisis include but are not limited to:
- Fava beans (broad beans)Â 
- Moth balls (found in old clothes - contain naphthaline)Â 
- IllnessÂ 
- Drugs (NSAIDS, antimalarials, sulphonamides)
Grapefruit juice is a Cytochrome P450 inhibitor and is therefore contraindicated in conjunction with a range of medications.




A haemolytic anaemia has 5 key features:
1. Raised unconjugated bilirubinÂ 
2. Reduced haptoglobinÂ 
3. Raised LDHÂ 
4. Increased urinary urobilinogenÂ 
5. Reticulocytosis

Anxiety Disorders,"<p>Generalised anxiety disorder is defined as ""persistent and excessive anxiety"".
Its aetiology is thought to be multifactorial, with both genetic components (avoidant/anxious personalities) and environmental components (life stress, anxious parents).
Â 2 week history of lightheadedness, occasional palpitations, sweating and feelings of impending doom.
These symptoms are examples of autonomic features of anxiety disorder. They are commonly mistaken for signs of underlying organic disease.
Other groups of symptoms include psychological and motor (trembling and restlessness).
Key epidemiology of GAD:
Affects up to 5% of the population (very common)Â 
- Onset occurs at a young age (15-25 years)Â 
- Aetiology is combination of genetics and environment
Phaechromocytoma
Panic disorder
Phobic disorder
Thyrotoxicosis
Delirium tremens

All of the above are important differentials!
This question illustrates that both organic and non-organic problems may manifest with the features of GAD.

Mood Disorders,"<p>According to both the ICD-10 and DSM-IV classifications, a history of hypomania is sufficient for diagnosis of bipolar disorder (assuming that other criteria are met).
The disorder has a predilection for males.
Although mania is usually characterised by abnormal elevation of mood, it may present as an overly suspicious and/or irritable mood.
Severely manic patients may well display psychotic symptoms.
Although the diurnal variation typically associated with depression involves a mood which is at its lowest in the morning but improves throughout the day, the opposite may also be true.
Psychotic symptoms may be present in cases of severe depression. Hallucinations tend to be mood congruent (i.e. voices heard are more likely to be accusatory or defamatory and olfactory hallucinations are generally unpleasant).
Depression in the elderly is hugely underdiagnosed. The fact that it may present similarly to dementia is partly to blame, as is the increased tendency of depressed elderly patients to complain of somatic rather than mood-related symptoms.
The presence of psychomotor (rather than mental) retardation is a feature suggestive of severe depression and may progress to stupor.
Although cyclothymia is defined as a persistent instability of mood, the presence of a stable mood lasting for several months does not preclude or negate its diagnosis.

Carbamazepine can be used as a prophylactic agent in patients with refractory bipolar disorder.
Although mania is associated with a lack of insight, interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy may be useful if conducted during periods of euthymia or even depression. Education may help patients and/or their families to recognise early or prodromal symptoms of mania (for example), thus enabling early intervention which may prevent or at least minimise the severity of subsequent episodes.
The National Institute of Clinical Excellence recommends the use of ECT ""for the treatment of severe depressive illness, a prolonged or severe episode of mania, or catatonia"". Its use in these contexts is limited to patients who have previously responded well to the therapy or ""to gain fast and short-term improvement of severe symptoms after all other treatment options have failed or when the situation is thought to be life-threatening
Whilst all of the features described may occur during an episode of depression, only one of them has been recorded under the correct heading. (It is hoped that any delusions encountered would be explored and recorded in more detail!)
The mental state examination is a key diagnostic tool and its various components should be thoroughly understood and memorised.

Buspirone.. not ass with dependence , used to treat GAD</p><p>All antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drugs are thought to block D2 receptors and may thus cause extrapyramidal side-effects (EPSEs). Atypical antipsychotics seem to have a lower affinity for D2 receptors, however, and are thought to act upon the 5-HT2A receptors.
As flupentixol is a typical antipsychotic, it is more likely to cause EPSEs than is olanzipine.
Risperidone is an example of an atypical antipsychotic drug.
Blockade of alpha-adrenergic, muscarinic, histaminergic and serotonergic receptors is caused by all antipsychotic medications to varying degrees.
Alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade is not limited to atypical antipsychotics

Extrapyramidal side-effects can be divided as follows:
1. Pseudoparkinsonism (muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor) 
2. Acute dystonia (involuntary, sustained muscular contractions - including jaw clenching and OCULOGYRIC CRISIS) 
3. Akathisia (subjective feelings of restlessness or discomfort) 
4. Tardive dyskinesia (rhythmic involuntary movements - usually of head, limbs or trunk and including chewing, grimacing and darting movements of the tongue)

Treatment with clozapine necessitates regular haematological monitoring (FBC) as agranulocytosis could lead to neutropenia-related death.
(N.B. Neutropenia itself is also associated with other drugs, such as olanzipine.)

Anxiolytics (such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide) have longer half-lives than so-called hypnotics (such as lorazepam and temazepam).
Benzodiazepines potentiate the inhibitory effects of GABA.
The interactions of benzodiazepines vary from drug to drug, necessitating careful inspection of the BNF prior to their prescription. However, tricyclic antidepressants are known to increase the sedative effect of anxiolytics and hypnotics in general

Renal Medicine in 50 minutes,"<p>Nephrotic syndrome
1. proteinuria
2. hypoalbuminaemia
3. Oedema

if loose protein = loose albumin as it is the key protein in the blood
loose albumin = starling hypothesis
cannot pull back fluid from capilaries = oedema
loose protein = loose Ig = low immunity
loose intinsic anticoagulants

Specific presentation:
periorbital oedema
peripheral oedema
ascities 
pleural effusion

Causes:
diabetic nephropathy
Children - minimal change disease = give steroids

Nephritic
1. Proteinuria < nephrotic
2. Haematuria
3. fluid overload - acute onset oedema = pleural oedema, rather than eyes and peripheries

Less oedema as less protein loss
Brown urine

Causes
Adults - IgA nephropathy
Child - Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis
- throat infection with streptococcus devel an immune response = glomerulonephritis</p><p>Acute Renal failure
problems
1. uraemia
2. fluid overload - pul oedema
3. electrolytes - hyperkalaemia
4. acid base regulation - acidosis

urinalysis - protein, blood, infection
bloods- U+E 
CXR - fluid overload
AXR - stones
ultrasound - 
size 
symmetry 
hydronephrosis = dilatation of the outflow of the kidney,
hydroureter = dilatation of the ureter

ECG - hyperkalaemia = tall tented T waves, can lead to arrhythmias</p><p>Treatment
Hyperkalamia: protect the heart, prevent arrhythmias
calcium gluconate
Insulin - net shift of K from blood into cells
dextrose

Oedema = diuretics

Acidosis
bicarbonate
dialysis

Immunosuppresion = steroids
raised MCV + raised GammaGT + anaemia = alcohol, vit deficiency
Acutely - urea up before creatinine
Chronic - creatine much higher

</p><strong>Chronic Renal Failure</strong><br /><br /><p>persitant irreversible
5 stages
5th stage = end stage renal failure
Cause
diabetes mellitis
hypertension
glomerular nephritis

Affects nervous sytem
peripheral neuropathy - urea
tired and fatigue - renal encephalopathy due to elevated urea

accelerated atherogenesis 

reduced absorption of Ca
- Hydroxlation of Vit D = bone prob
low levels of Ca = stim parathyroid
osteodystophy
oesteocysts

hyperkalemia
acidosis

Prod EPO = stim bone marrow to prod RBC
normocytic anaemia of chronic disease

impaired platelet function = bruise easily</p>",6227,10,46,2012-12-31 15:51:06 UTC,2012-12-31 15:51:06 UTC

Respiratory acidosis:low ph, high CO2 acute-low/normal bicarbonate. Chronic: kidneys compensating producing bicarbonate(high) if acute on chronic them o2 still low, pH low. Both may be normal in chronic.

Respiratory alkalosis: high pO2, low pCO2, high pH, commonly anxiety
Metabolic acidosis: high o2 and low CO2, often kussmaul breathing with increased tidal volume. low bicarbonate
Anion gap: positive minus negative normal 8 - 12. High gap means something else is contributing e.g. ketones, lactic acid

type 1 - normal/low pCO2. V/Q mismatch. Causes: PE, acute LVF, acute asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, severe pneumonia
Blood leaves with low o2 and raised co2. co2 compensated by increased ventilation of perfused alveoli. hypoxia cannot be compensated for due to haemoglobin already being fully saturated. 
type II high co2. COPD, NMD, severe acute asthma attack with significant tiring due to hyperventilation. (conditions can cause I/II) alveolar hypoventilation
Acute: sudden reduction returns to normal when treated
Chronic: compensated, fewer symptoms BUT complications:pulmonary hypertension (persitent vasoconstriction), RVF, polycythaemia - increased epo production

Found in hepatocytes, involved in amino acid metabolism
When hepatocytes die they are elevated
Both present in other tissues in small amounts
AST rises more than ALT in alcohol/cirrhosis problems
AST:ALT ratio normally 1, over 2 in liver damage

Hepatic failure = over 90% of the functional capacity of the liver is lost
Can be acute/chronic</p><strong>Acute hepatic failure</strong><br /><br /><strong>Pathophys</strong><br /><br /><strong>Causes of liver disease</strong><br /><br /><p>Hepatocytes = liver cells
Kupffer cells = macrophages on sinusoidal epithelium
Stellate cells = can cause myofibroblasts with repeated injury forming collagen

Consequences of damaged liver functions:
- Detoxifications - encephalopathy and cerebral oedema
- Glycogen storage - hypoglycaemia
- Clotting factors - coagulopathy and bleeding
- Immunological function - infections
- Homeostasis - affects kidneys and lungs</p><strong>Differentiating Hepatitis and acute liver failure</strong><br /><br /><p>Hepatitis = liver inflammation, self limiting, caused by viruses, drugs, different to acute liver failure
Liver failure = more catastrophic loss of function, caused by decompensation or can be rarely due to fulminant hepatitis

Hepatitis
Symptoms: very unwell, fever, malaise, nausea, mild RUQ pain
Signs: jaundice, tender hepatomegaly
May have severely deranged LFTs

Viral hepatitis:
- A = acute, due to faeco-oral route, 100% recovery
- B = 80% recover, 20% chronic
- C = 20% recover, 80% chronic, can't be vaccinated against</p><p>= Persistent liver damage over a long period
Due to progressive fibrosis -> Cirrhosis (irreversible), which can decompensate

Triad of damage in cirrhosis:
1. Fibrosis
2. Nodules of regenerating hepatocytes
3. Distortion of liver architecture affecting function of liver -> shunting, underperfusion
Stellate cells produce collagen

Complications:
- Decompensated hepatic failure
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (damaged cells more likely to be malignant)
- Portal hypertension = increased pressure in portal venous system which drains gut into liver. Can result in:
1. Ascites (due to increased hydrostatic pressure in gut)
2. Porto-systemic shunts (affects points where portal venous system anastamoses with systemic venous system) -> oesophageal varices, haemorrhoids, caput medusa
- Splenomegaly (due to portal hypertension)

Causes of chronic liver disease:
Common: Alcoholic liver disease, steatohepatitis (fatty liver), Hep C
Less common: Autoimmune e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis (causes obstruction), Hep B
Rare: A1AT deficiency, Wilson's Disease, Haemochromatosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis (inflam of bile duct)</p><strong>Chronic Liver Disease</strong><br /><br /><strong>Alcoholic liver disease</strong><br /><br /><strong>Chronic liver disease</strong><br /><br /><strong>Acute hepatic failure</strong><br /><br /><p>Due to sudden massive damage OR decompensation of chronic liver disease
Causes of decompensation: GI bleed, sepsis, drugs

Features:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy
Due to build up of unwanted metabolites 
Irritability -> sleep disturbance -> disorientation -> coma
2. Jaundice (conjugated)
3. Coagulopathy (raised INR)
4. Infection (-> sepsis and multi-organ failure)
5. Organ failure (lungs, kidneys)</p><p>3 distinct pathologies:
1. Alcoholic hepatitis - Acute with a binge
2. Alcoholic fatty liver
3. Alcoholic cirrhosis

Autoimmune hepatitis:
Usually following trivial infection
Features: Middle aged women with other autoimmune disease, high ALT/AST, High IgG, ANA + Anti-smooth muscle antibodies
Responds well to steroids

Primary biliary cirrhosis:
- Intrahepatic bile ducts are affected -> progressive cirrhosis
- Presents with pruritis
- Raised ALP and GGT (because it's in the liver)
- Anti-mitochondrial IgM antibody

Primary sclerosing cholangitis:
- Sclerosis of intra and extra hepatic ducts
- Heavily associated with ulcerative colitis
- Raised ALP only (because it's outside liver mainly)
- Risk of cholangiocarcinoma</p><strong>Non-Alcoholic Liver disease</strong><br /><br /><p>Wilson's disease:
= Disorder of copper transport protein
Autosomal dominant inherites
So copper accumulates in liver -> hepatolenticular degeneration
Also affects brain/eyes -> Neurology and Keyser-Fleisher rings
Investigations: copper and ceruloplasmin low

Haemochromatosis:
= Excessive absorption of iron from gut due to gene mutation -> iron build up in liver
Hereditary
Normally seen in elderly because iron builds up over years
Also affects pancreas, heart, pituitary, heart, gonads -> cirrhosis, diabetes, HF, arthritis, hypogonadism, hypopituitarism

Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency:
Inherited disorder
A1A is produced by liver and imhibits protease enzymes
If deficient you get deposition of excessive abnormal A1AT protein in liver cells
Also affects lungs as proteases then damage lungs</p>",6063,4,23,2012-12-31 15:50:23 UTC,2012-12-31 15:50:24 UTC

Pituitary and Adrenal Disease,"<strong>Hyperpituitarism: Pituitary adenomas</strong><br /><br /><p>Prolactinoma (most common):
- Presentation in people with no menstrual cycle (men and post-menopausal women): late presentation of symptoms, non-specific headache, visual disturbance
- Presentation in menstruating women: Early symptoms, Stimulation of lactation, Prolactin inhibits GNRH -> inhibits FSH/LH causing menstrual cycle disturbance, also gives you non-specific symptoms
- So typical MEQ presentation of prolactinoma: early morning headaches, vomiting, menstrual cycle disturbance

Management: Measure basal prolactin, MRI
Treatment: Dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline), transphenoidal surgery if drug therapy fails or serious symptoms</p><p>= benign neoplasm of glandular tissue of anterior pituitary

2 Basic types
1. Non-functional - common, produce no hormones, cause few problems

Pituitary connected to hypothalamus and is near to optic chiasm</p><strong>Overview of Pituitary Disease</strong><br /><br /><strong>Prolactinoma</strong><br /><br /><p>Problems can be with hormones produced or with disease of pituitary causing a mass effect (affecting structures near pituitary)

Hormonal effects:
- Hyperpituitarism (rare)
- Hypopituitarism (common)

Mass effects:
- Any SOL in brain causes non-specific symptoms e.g. headaches
- Optic chiasm - any enlargement of pituitary can compress this -> causes bitemporal hemianopia
- Further enlargement can invade cavernous sinouses -> affects CN III, IV, VI -> Diplopia</p><p>2nd commonest
Children - gigantism, Adults - acromegaly, cardiac disease, diabetes
Acromegaly features: 
- Facial: thick skin and lips, mandibular protrusion
- Enlargement of hands and feet
- Increased sweating
- Carpal tunnel syndrome

Management: 
Serum IGF-1 (but 25% don't show up +ve with acromegaly)
OGTT - glucose suppresses GH, if GH not suppressed after OGTT there's a problem
Treatment: surgery</p><strong>Steroid hormone disorders (Adrenal disease)</strong><br /><br /><p>Adrenal glands structure:
Cortex (80%)
- Glomerulosa - produces aldosterone (mineralocorticoid)
- Fasiculata - produces cortisol (glucocorticoid)
- Reticularis - produces sex hormones (androgens)
(Remember: GFR ACS)
Medulla (20%) - produces noradrenaline/adrenaline

Can have hyper/hypo function of cortex
Hyperfunction:
- Glucocorticoids -> Cushing's syndrome
- Aldosterone -> Conn's syndrome
(- Androgens -> complicated virilisation syndromes e.g. congenital adrenal hyperplasia)</p><strong>Hyperfunction of Adrenal Cortex</strong><br /><br /><p>Diabetes insipidus
Type 1: Cranial = not enough ADH not being produced
Type 2: Nephrogenic = kidneys don't respond to ADH
Causes of cranial DI are the same as the causes of hypopituitarism
Features: polyuria, polydypsia, hyponatraemia (due to water loss), low glucose in urine (differentiates from DM)
Diagnosis: water deprivation test - measures ability of kidneys to concentrate urine - bad if no ADH
Treatment: Desmopressin (ADH replacement) if cranial, delivered intranasally</p><p>Rare, usually partial - causes non-specific features
Causes: Adenoma (usually big), metastases, iatrogenic (surgery/radiation), head injuries, childbirth (postpartum ischaemic necrosis)</p><strong>Hypopituitarism</strong><br /><br /><strong>ACTH secreting adenoma</strong><br /><br /><strong>Diabetes insipidus (anterior pituitary)</strong><br /><br /><p>ACTH causes production of cortisol by adrenal gland -> Cushing's syndrome if too much cortisol
Cushing's syndrome in association with a pituitary adenoma secreting ACTH = Cushing's disease
Features of Cushing's: Hypokalaemia, hypernatraemia, high ACTH, high cortisol
</p><strong>Glucocorticoid excess -> Cushing's syndrome</strong><br /><br /><p>Not all glucocorticoids have their disease basis in the adrenal cortex, adrenal tumour is the only example of this
Exogenous sources of high cortisol - oral/inhaled steroids
Endogenous sources of high cortisol:
- Pituitary adenoma (=Cushing's disease, high ACTH secretion)
- Adrenal tumour/hyperplasia
- Ectopic production of steroids (e.g. lung tumours)

Cushing's syndrome (=symptoms of prolonged high cortisol levels)
- Causes: Iatrogenic (oral steroids), Pituitary tumour, Ectopic, Adrenal tumour
- Features: Moon face, thin skin, easy bruising, central obesity, proximal myopathy, striae, buffalo hump

- Diagnosis: 
1. Low potassium, high sodium ALWAYS makes you think Cushing's
2. Diagnosis: 
a. Midnight plasma cortisol (levels usually lowest at midnight but would be high in Cushing's)
b. Low dose (1mg) dexamethasone test (dexamethasone = a glucocorticoid) = take DEXA at midnight, measure in morning, if low they don't have Cushing's
3. Determining cause: 
a.Plasma ACTH (produced by ant. pituitary)
-- If ACTH High - caused by pituitary adeoma/ectopic source
-- If ACTH Low - must be suppressed by something else e.g. adrenal cortex tumour, iatrogenic 
b. High dose (2mg) DEXA test
Administer 2mg 6-hourly for 2 days, measure cortisol
In pituitary adenoma, cortisol is suppressed (if you bombard it with enough cortisol)
In ectopic, cortisol is not suppressed

- Treatment: Reduce steroids, Ketoconazole, Metyrapone, Trilostane</p><p>Conn's syndrome (rare) = aldosterone producing adenoma
Causes hypertension and hypokalaemia (no hypernatraemia)
Causes: 
Primary (causes reduced renin) - adenoma, bilateral hyperplasia of adrenal gland
Secondary (causes increased renin) - e.g. Heart failure causes increased RAAS activation</p><strong>Hypofunction of Adrenal Cortex</strong><br /><br /><strong>Phaeochromocytoma</strong><br /><br /><p>More common

Features: 
- Hypovolaemia
- Hypoglycaemia
- Hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia (K/Na opposite to Cushing's

Causes:
- Decompensated Addison's (Addison's patient gets infection but doesn't increase oral steroids) - most common cause
- Severe sepsis
- Steroid withdrawal (after long term steroid use)</p><p>= Neuroendocrine tumour of chromaffin cells of adrenal medulla
Produce catecholamines (noradrenaline/adrenaline)
A cause of secondary hypertension
Symptoms: headaches, anxiety, hot flushes
Diagnosis: 
- 24h urine collection = gold standard, look for VMA (breakdown product of catecholamines, will be high in disease)
- CT Adrenals
Treatment: Medical: Phenoxybenzamine (controls hypertension), surgery</p><p>Very difficult to diagnose
Features are vague: Fatigue, weakness, anorexia, weight loss, dizziness, depression, abdo symptoms
But always look out for:
- Hyperpigmentation due to breakdown product of high ACTH
- Postural hypotension due to inability to sustain BP if low glucocorticoids
- Associated vitiligo/patients with autoimmune disease can present with Addison's

Diagnosis: 
- Cortisol but most aren't low enough to diagnose
- Short synacthen test = gold standard, give ACTH and measure levels , if normal you would expect cortisol to go up, if abnormal it won't</p><strong>Mineralocorticoid excess -> Conn's syndrome</strong><br /><br /><strong>Adrenal Medulla Disorders</strong><br /><br />",6063,5,27,2012-12-31 15:50:23 UTC,2012-12-31 15:50:23 UTC
Upper GI Pathology,"<p>2 tyoes:
- Squamous - smoking and alcohol, more common in middle third, also associated with achalasia
- Adeno - Barrett's, more common in lower oesophagus

Presentation usually late
Dysphagia, malaise, weight loss</p><strong>Achalasia</strong><br /><br /><p>= motility disorder, lower oesophageal sphincter fails to relax after swallowing, oesophageal wall doesn't transmit peristaltic waves, hypertrophy of oesophagus, becomes dilated and full of fluid and food

Cause: immune mediated destruction
Presentation: slowly preogressive dysphagia
Endoscopy vital
Can progress to SCC</p><strong>Oesophagus</strong><br /><br /><strong>GORD and complications</strong><br /><br /><p>Squamous lining becomes inflamed -> oesophagitis
RFs: 
1. Increased intra-abdo pressure e.g. pregnancy
2. Sliding hiatus hernia = when GO junction drawn upwards so pouch of stomach is located in thorax, so GO junction can't work as an anti-reflux barrier
Symptoms: retro-sternal pain, heartburn

Complications:
1. Peptic stricture = benign narrowing of oesophagus caused by scarring and deformation of wall, important because the narrowing can look like carcinoma

2. Barrett's oesophagus = columnar metaplasia of lower oesophagus - visible macroscopically but must biopsy to see if it has invaded the basement membrane, precursor to oesophageal adenocarcinoma
Should be endoscopied regularly, but still low risk of death
After biopsy: low grade (6 monthly biopsy)/high grade (oesophagectomy)</p><strong>Oesophageal carcinoma</strong><br /><br /><strong>Stomach</strong><br /><br /><strong>Peptic ulcer disease</strong><br /><br /><p>Usually develop with a background of chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia due to H. Pylori or autoimmune gastritis

Carcinomas
Almost always adenocarcinomas
Intestinal - found with gastritis -> metaplasia -> dysplasia, H. Pylori related
Diffuse - found in normal mucosa, Signet ring cells due to high gastric musin, encases entire stomach with tumour -> leather bottle stomach

Lymphomas
Derived from B lymphocytes
Not normally any lymphoid tissue in stomach walls
BUT Inflammation with H. Pylori -> lymphocytes recruited into stomach wall
-> continued stimulation of these lymphocytes -> marginal zone lymphoma
Responds to antibiotics

Stromal Tumours (rare)
Connective tissue origin, derived from pacemaker cells of bowel</p><p>Full thickness breach of mucosa of lower oesophagus, stomach or duodenum
Usually solitary, found in antrum or start of duodenum
Associated with gastritis and acid hypersecretion, or NSAIDs
Looks like punched out lesion with defined edges

Complications:
1. Haemorrhage -> massive haematemesis
2. Perforation -> acute abdo pain, peritonitis
3. Fibrous stricture -> gastric outflow obstruction, vomiting, distension</p><strong>Gastric Tumours</strong><br /><br /><p>Red gastric mucosa endoscopically
Most commonly caused by H. Pylori (gram -ve)

H. Pylori can manifest in 3 ways depending on how much acid is produced:
1. In 80% of patients (less acidic) - H. Pylori results in an asymptomatic pan-gastritis - bacteria spread and there is mild inflammation
2. In acid hypersecretors - H. Pylori causes large increase in acid secretion, acid goes into duodenum -> inflammation -> gastric metaplasia -> duodenum colonised by H. Pylori -> peptic ulceration
3. In acid hyposecretors - bacteria can heavily colonise stomach -> gastritis -> further suppressing acid secretion -> further colonisation and inflammation -> destruction of acid secreting glands -> chronic atrophic gastritis -> gastric epithelium metaplasia to intestinal type (RF for gastric carcinoma)

Autoimmune gastritis: 
Destruction of gastric parietal cells (generate acid) which are found in body and fundus (H. Pylori = inflammation in antrum)
-> Destruction and atrophy -> intestinal metaplasia -> risk of gastric carcinoma and pernicious anaemia

Chemical/Reactive gastritis: Due to ingestion of gastric irritants e.g. NSAIDs/alcohol

Erosive/haemorrhagic gastritis: Multiple defects in gastric mucosa and bleeding, Due to ingestion of large amounts of NSAIDS/alcohol, OR in acutely unwell patient with low blood flow to stomach, usually heals rapidly</p><p>Defenses of stomach wall to acid: mucous layer, bicarbonate, blood flow

Exocrine = production of proteases (trypsin), lipases, amylases
 
Pathologies: 2 congenital:
1. Annular pancreas = embryonic malfunction, pancreas wraps itself around lumen
2. Pancreas divisum = incomplete fusion -> predisposition to pancreatitis

Pancreatitis (acute/chronic)
Pancreatic carcinoma</p><strong>Acute pancreatitis</strong><br /><br /><p>= inflammation leading to activation and release of destructive enzymes

Causes: 
1. alcohol - occurs after heavy drinking
2. gallstones -> reflux of bile and duodenal content
Other: ERCP, drugs (azathioprine, steroids), hypercalcaemia, viruses
25% idiopathic

Presentation: acute severe central abdo pain, N&V, no guarding/rebound tenderness (peritoneal signs) as pancreas is retroperitoneal
Investigations: amylase (high)
Can be mild/severe/life threatening
E.g. hypovolaemia, infection from bowel</p><strong>Chronic pancreatitis</strong><br /><br /><p>= Persistent inflammation and scarring, often with reduced function/pancreatic failure
Causes: alcohol, CF, pancreas divisum, autoimmune disease

Upper Respiratory Disorders in Children,"<p>5 key presentaions in children: 1. cough 2. wheeze 3. stridor 4. breathlessness 5. snoring
Main differential is pneumonia</p><strong>Croup</strong><br /><br /><p>= Laryngotracheobonchitis
Characterised by inspiraratory stridor = high pitched wheezing sound resulting from turbulent air flow in the upper airway, usually inspiratory
10-15% of under 5s get it

Pathophys:
Usually caused by Influenza/RSV viruses
Viral infection -> infiltration of WBCs -> swelling of larynx, trachea, large airways -> swelling causes airway obstruction

Features:
Differentiate between acute epiglottitis by croup having slower onset (days not hours), no fever, feeding well
Preceded by a cold
Symptoms: Barking cough, hoarse voice, difficulty breathing, stridor, usually worse at night

Investigations: 
Assess degree of airway obstruction 
Westley score for croup severity: Stridor, chest wall retraction, cyanosis, consciousness, air entry
Dont examine throat as can make oedema worse
Bloods (FBC, CRP)
CXR - Steeple sign (swelling of throat)

Treatment: humidified oxygen, steroids, nebulised adrenaline, heliox (decreases work of breathing), treat secondary bacterial infection, NO ANTIBIOTICS (it's viral)</p><strong>Acute epiglottitis</strong><br /><br /><p>= a rapidly progressive life threatening condition with viral infection, inflammation and oedema of epiglottis and surrounding tissues -> obstruction
Most common 2-8y, incidence reduced since HiB vaccination

Pathophys:

Features: Symptoms within hours
Odynophagia (painful swallowing), muffled voice, drooling, fever
Can start as cough/ear pain
Red flags: breathlessness, resp distress, dysphagia, stridor

Investigations: Secure airway, get help!
Do not examine throat
Fibreoptic laryngoscopy is gold standard, 
Also lateral neck xray, throat swabs, blood cultures, CT/MRI if abscess suspected

Treatment:
Intubation may be neccessary, Antibiotics - broad spectrum, Steroids
</p><strong>Whooping cough</strong><br /><br /><p>= Infection and inflammation of large airways caused by Bordella Pertussis
Uncommon due to immunisation

Investigations: exclude pneumonia
Urine culture, FBC, U&E, CXR, ECG, Nasal swabs

Treatment: will resolve in time, admit if apnoea, cyanosis or respiratory distress
Risk of seizures, encephalopathy and death
Erythromicin/isolation if neccessary
Treat contacts
Atypical</p><strong>Bronchiolitis</strong><br /><br /><p>= seasonal (winter) viral illness
Fever, nasal discharge, wheezy cough, fine insp crackles, high pitched exp wheeze

RSV usually, 70% of infants infected with RSV in first year of life, 22% symptomatic

Pathophys: Invades nasopharyngeal epithelium, transmitted down resp tract, inflammation and oedema

Features: dry cough, worsening breathlessness, wheeze, feeding difficulty, apnoea
Assess resp distress: Intercostal recession, accessory muscles, tachypnoea, cyanosis, grunting
Take O2 sats
Listen for wheezes/crackles
Investigations: O2 sats, CXR, throat swabs, consider ABG
Treatment: 
Sats below 92% give O2
Limit oral feeding if breathless due to aspiration risk + give NG tube if neccessary for feeding
Bronchodilators for wheezing

Arthritis,"<strong>Rheumatoid arthritis - RF seropositive</strong><br /><br /><p>= Systemic disease characterised by chronic symmetrical polyarthropathy
Affects small joints e.g. hands/wrists, and some other joints e.g. elbow/shoulders/knees/feet
Rheumatoid factor (autoantibody) positive in 70%

Pathophysiology:
Chronic synovitis with pannus formation (pannus erodes cartilage/bone/tendons)
Characterised by autoimmune mediated activation of CD4+ T cells within joints -> release of proinflammatory cytokines -> destruction of joint
Pathological changes:
1.	Rheumatoid synovitis
Synovium swollen, villous pattern
Chronic inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and plasma cells) increase in number in synovium
Forms an exudates that effuses into joint space
Fibrin is deposited onto surface of synovium ï  hypertrophy
2.	Articular cartilage destruction
Inflammatory granulation tissue grows across surface of joint
Loss of articular cartilage
3.	Focal destruction of bone
Osteolytic destruction occurs at edges of joint
Joint deformity
Increased soft tissue swelling due to inflammation
Thickening of synovium and capsule

RFs: female, onset age 30-40, FH, RF+ve, 

History:
- swollen painful stiff hands/feet -> larger joints

Investigations:
- Bloods: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, ESR, RhF, autoantibodies
- X-ray
- Aspiration of synovial fluid - appearance, microscopy, WCC, culture

Management:
Aims: control symptoms, maintain normal life, modify underlying disease
Conservative: physio, resting, splints
Surgery for joint deformities
Drugs:
1. Analgesia - paracetamol, NSAID
2. DMARDs:
- Methotrexate - folate antagonist, SEs: GI, bone marrow, hepatic, pulmonary toxicity so regular bloods needed
- Sulfasalazine - SEs: rashes, GI, bone marrow suppression, hepatitis
- Leflunomide (inhibits pyramidine synthesis)
- Antimalarials - hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, well tolerated but not as effective
- Gold/penicillamine- rare due to SEs of bone marrow suppression, rashes, nephrotic syndrome
3. Steroids - only used if other anti-inflammatories unsuccessful due to long term SEs, steroid injections can be given
4. TNF inhibitors - entercept, infliximab, SEs: infection - reactivation of TB, expensive so only use if unresponsive to DMARDs</p><strong>Seronegative</strong><br /><br /><p>Colonic (enterohepatic), associated with Crohn's

Calcium Handling,"<p>Serum calcium = 2.2-2.6mmol/l
In blood, 50% is unbound, the other 50% is bound to albumin
The lab usually measures the total calcium conc and corrects for albumin

Calcium levels regulated by PTH, acts on bones, kidneys and gut
Vit D enhances absorption of calcium from gut</p><strong>Hypocalcaemia</strong><br /><br /><p>Causes: PTH removal, Vit D Deficiency (malabsorption, malnutrition, lack of exposure to sunlight), renal disease, pseudohypoparathyroidism (failure of tissue receptors to respond to hormone)

Diagnosis: U&E (to exclude renal disease), PTH
If PTH is low - parathyroid not working properly/Mg deficiency
If PTH is high - vit D Deficiency/pseudoypoparathyroidism

Clinical features:
Asymptomatic
Neuro - fits, Trousseau's sign (spasm when inflating BP cuff)
Cardiac - prolonged QT -> arrhythmia
Eyes - cataracts

Treatment - calcium if mild, colcitriol or synthetic vit D if severe</p><strong>Hypercalcaemia</strong><br /><br /><p>Causes: 1. Primary hyperparathyroidism usually due to adenoma 2. Malignancy Other: granulomas (TB/sarcoid), diuretics, renal disease
Diagnosis: Ca, PTH, U&E
PTH undetectable = pathology outside parathyroid, calcium high enough to suppress gland usually due to malignancy
PTH present/high = primary hyperparathyroidism

Clinical features:
Asymptomatic OR
Bones - high PTH causes bone resorption
Stones - kidney stones
Groans - abdo pain, N&V, constipation
Throans - Polyuria, thirst
Moans - weakness, fatigue, altered mental state

Treatment: fluids (to promote diuresis of calcium), bisphosphonates (to inhibit further bone resorption, surgical removal of adenoma
Bisphosphonates encourage osteoclasts (which usually break down bone) to apoptose, so they prevent the loss of bone mass</p>",6063,9,41,2012-12-31 15:50:23 UTC,2012-12-31 15:50:23 UTC

Severe: over 6 or characteristic ECG changes</p><strong>Common causes</strong><br /><br /><p>1. Renal failure e.g. in volume depletion -> hypoperfusion
2. Drugs e.g. K sparing diuretics (amiloride), spironolactone, NSAIDs, ACE inhibs

Other causes:
- Increased potassium release e.g. cellular shifts in acidosis, cellular destruction in haemolysis, cytotoxic drugs
- Decreased potassium excretion e.g. renal failure, Addison's, ACE inhibs, spironolactone, amiloride (K sparing diuretic)

Renal failure:
- Pre renal - most common, due to underperfusion of kidneys - always suspect this in hyperkalaemia - look at U&E</p><strong>Clinical features</strong><br /><br /><p>ECG: Low flat p waves, broad bizzare QRS, slurring into the ST, tall tented T waves. also prolonged PR, prolonged QT, can progress to VT
Weakness, paralysis (rare)</p><strong>Management</strong><br /><br /><p>Mild: continue monitoring, review drugs, reduce IV K+
Severe: 
- 1. repeat sample (is it due to haemolysed blood)
- 2. Check U&Es for renal failure
- 3. ECG and ABG

To protect the myocardium - IV calcium gluconate
To drive K back into cells - actrapid insulin, glucose IV, can give calcium resonium + laxative, can give salbutamol

Fractures,"<p>Function of skeleton - structure/support, haematopoiesis, calcium homeostasis

Diaphysis = shaft
Epiphysis = ends, epiphyseal plate in children
Metaphysis = widening before epiphysis

Cortical bone = compact, majority of skeleton, dense, resists compression forces, found in diaphysis
Cancellous bone = central mass of bones, less dense, found in metaphysis

Fracture = disruption of cortex of bone
Dislocation = complete disruption of joint
Subluxation = partial disruption of joint

With fractures always make sure there is no neurovascular damage</p><strong>Mechanism of fracture</strong><br /><br /><p>Direct/Indirect force needed to fracture a bone
Pathological fracture: An abnormal bone may fracture under a normal load 
Fatigue fracture: A normal bone may fracture with repeated normal loads

- Type - Transverse, oblique, spiral, impacted, hairline, greenstick, buckle
- Location - name and part of bone, is it epiphyseal/diaphyseal/metaphyseal/NOF?
- Displacement - describes distal in relation to proximal fragment, fractures are either displaced or not displaced. If displaced describe as: translation, angulation, shortening, rotation



Don't forget to describe soft tissues e.g. fat pads

</p><strong>Paediatric fractures</strong><br /><br /><p>Important because damage to the epiphyseal plate can affect bone growth
Salter-Harris classification has prognostic value and influences treatment decisions:
S - type 1 slipped - fracture separates epiphysis from shaft
A - type 2 above (most common) - fracture line lies above the plate with a triangular fragment of metaphysis
L - type 3 lower - fracture line runs below plate so fragment is epiphysis
T - type 4 through - fracture line runs through epiphyseal plate vertically
R - type 5 rammed (rare) - epiphysis is crushed</p><strong>Fracture management</strong><br /><br /><p>Conservative = manipulate, immobilise, physio

- No investigations - diagnosed on H&E
- Management: analgesia, keep active

2. Disc prolapse = tear in annulus of disc causing herniation of nucleus propulsus, most commonly = L5-S1, small chance of SCC/cauda equina so ensure you rule out
- Hx: leaning forwards -> hearing a popping sound -> back pain, usually have sciatic pain due to irritation, straight leg raising is positive

- Investigations: MRI/CT
- Management: physio, analgesia, if severe surgery

Neurogenic claudication = pain relieved by leaning forwards and worse on exercise
In spinal stenosis veins supplying spinal cord get squashed -> venous return impeded -> venous congestion
If you exercise -> venous return from legs increases -> blood flow through spinal cord veins increases -> venous congestion gets worse -> veins dilate more -> squash nerve root -> more leg pain
If you stop exercise -> venous return from legs decreases -> spinal cord veins less dilated -> pressure relieved -> pain improves

4. Spondylolisthesis = where one vertebrae slips forwards relative to the above one, usually L5
- Features: lower back pain worse on standing, radiating to buttocks, increased lumbar lordosis, displaced vertebra on palpation

- Motor - complete claw hand (loss of lumbricals so can't extend fingers when MCPs are flexed), wasting of small muscles in hand

6. Mononeuritis multiplex: 2 or more single nerve lesions at same time or one after another, usually due to systemic cause
Causes:
Wegener's granulomatosis (autoimmune vasculitis)
Amyloidosis
Rheumatoid arthritis
Diabetes
Sarcoid
PAN
Leprosy
Carcinomatosis (metastases)</p><strong>Polyneuropathy</strong><br /><br /><p>= pathology of multiple nerves, usually symmetrical
Motor - LMN pattern of weakness (wasting, low reflexes, fasiculation, loss of sensation)
Sensory - parasthesia, glove and stocking loss of sensation
May present with unsteadiness on feet

Causes:
- Vascular: vasculitis
- Infection: HIV
- Neoplasia: myeloma
(- Trauma: none)
- Autoimmune: SLE, Guillan-Barre (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, post viral)
- Metabolic: diabetes, renal failure
(- Electrolytic: none)
(- Degenerative: none)

Treatment: treat the cause, neuropathic pain relief (gabapentin, amitryptiline)</p><strong>Examining the hands</strong><br /><br /><p>Think: is the cause rheumatology, neurology or general?

1. Look esp. contours of thenar eminences (median), hypothenar eminence and first dorsal interosseous

2. Feel contours and joints, areas of pain, PULSES

3. Move: Grip, thumb, wrist, fingers, fine movts, prayer sign 
- Grip - squeeze my fingers (powered by long flexors, mediated by C8 nerve root)
- Pincer grip - tests adductor pollicis (supplied by ulnar nerve) 
    - if this muscle is weak you get Froment's sign = flexion of end of thumb in pincer grip, test by pulling a piece of paper out of the hand
- Raise thumb when back of hand is flat on table to test abductor pollicis brevis (median)
- Other power: wrist extension, finger extension, finger abduction
- Fine movements e.g. play piano
- Prayer sign = palms together, elbows out
  - Positive causes: RA, scleroderma, diabetes, ulnar nerve palsy, T1 palsy (causes complete claw hand as it gives rise to median and ulnar), Dupytren's contracture, arthritis of wrist

4. Sensation:
- Thenar and hypothenar
- Back of hand
- Finger tips for dermatomes

5. Special tests: Tinel's and Phalen's, Froment's

Median nerve innervated muscles:
Lumbricals 1&2
Opponens pollicis (thenar eminence)
Abductor pollicis brevis (thenar eminence)
Flexor pollicis brevis (thenar eminence)

Upper limb nerve roots:
C5 - shoulder abduction
C6 - elbow flexion (brachioradialis)
C7 - wrist extension

- Ataxia and nystagmus (brainstem and cerebellar involvement)
- Urinary incontinence
- Pseudobulbar palsy
- Dementia
Death usually results from uraemia & bronchopneumonia</p><p>Difficult to diagnose due to relapse and remission, if 2 separate attacks affecting different parts of CNS, can be a clinical diagnosis
MRI of brain and spinal cord = best investigation, lesions seen in periventricular white matter, brainstem and cervical spinal cord
Others: LP and CSF culture, electrophysiology</p><p>Chronic inflammatory condition of CNS (UMN) - demyelination affecting brain and spinal cord, widely spread throughout the body, relapsing and remitting course
6/100,000 incidence, affecting 20-45yo, more common in women</p><strong>Pathogenesis</strong><br /><br /><p>Immune mediated attack on myelin -> inflammation and demyelination
Virus infection causes leaky BBB allowing B and T cells to cross -> axon damage and demyelination

Sites particularly affected explain the symptoms: 
1. optic nerve, 
2. brainstem and cerebellum, 
3. cervical spinal cord - posterior columns (sensory fine touch and proptioception) and spinothalamic tracts (sensory pain, temperature, crude touch)</p><strong>Clinical features</strong><br /><br /><strong>Features of end stage disease</strong><br /><br /><strong>Investigations</strong><br /><br /><strong>Management</strong><br /><br /><p>Can affect people in one of three ways:
1. Relapsing and remitting (80%) - often becomes secondary progressive after 10y
2. Primary progressive (10%) = gradual deterioration
3. Sudden and severe (under 10%)

Symptoms related to sites affected:
1. Optic neuropathy - usually worse in one eye, subacute onset with complete recovery in 2 months
Symptoms:
- Blurred vision over hours/days - like looking through frosted glass
- Mild ocular pain
Signs: 
- Sometimes none (if retrobulbar = behind optic disc) 
- Disc swelling if optic disc is affected
- Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) = swinging a light to the affected eye causes it to dilate not constrict

2. Brainstem demyelination
- Diplopia - CN VI (abducens) nerve most commonly affected, can also have internuclear ophthalmoplegia = disorder of conjugate lateral gaze
- Vertigo (+/- nystagmus)
- Pseudobulbar palsy -> dysarthria/dysphagia

3. Spinal cord lesion
Present with: 
- Difficulty walking
- Numbness in limbs
- Electric shock sensation in limbs - when flexing neck on examination you can reproduce this = Lhermitte's sign
Examination of lower limbs:
- Patchy sensory loss
- Spastic paraparesis

So... common presenting symptoms: numbness/electric shock in limbs, blurred vision, diplopia, vertigo, difficulty walking</p><p>Drugs:
- Acute relapses = short course of IV methylprednisolone reduces severity of attack
- Prevention of relapse = SC B-interferon reduces relapse rate, v. expensive
Other treatments:
- Living aids
- Treat infections esp. UTIs
- Incontinence - oxybutinine and self-catheterisation
- Spasticity - physio and muscle relaxants
- MDT involvement</p>",6063,12,57,2012-12-31 15:50:23 UTC,2012-12-31 15:50:23 UTC
Chronic Painless Visual Loss,"<p>Macula = spot on retina responsible for high resulotion vision
Very common
Key feature = drusen = yellow/white accumulations of extracellular material in Bruch's membrane

Complications = loss of vision due to:
- Geographic atrophy (Dry ARMD) = macular region wears away, characterised by slow loss of vision over years, central acuity affected, difficult to treat
- Subretinal neovascularisation (Wet ARMD) - rapid loss of vision over weeks/days, treated by laser photocoagulation</p><p>3 characteristic stages:
1. Background retinopathy - normal vision, microaneurysms, dot haemorrhages, hard exudates (lipid leakage into retina)
2. Pre-proliferative retinopathy - cotton wool spots (ischaemia in nerve fibre layer)
3. Proliferative retinopathy = chronic ischaemia in retina causing new leaky vessels to form -> haemorrhage, fibrosis, retinal detachment. Treated with lasers

Other visual problems in diabetes: fluctuating visual acuity, cataracts, mononeuropathy causing double vision (CNIII), bilateral papillopathy</p><p>Retinitis pigmentosa = group of inherited diseases affecting photoreceptors of retina
Can be dominant/recessive/X linked
Bilateral and symmetrical disease

Causes:
- Congenital - autosomal dominant inheritance, TORCH infections, maternal steroid use in pregnancy, metabolic conditions (hypoglycaemia/hypokalaemia), chromosomal abnormalities (Down's/Turners)
- Acquired - age related, trauma, diabetes, steroid use

Clinical features: Reduced visual acuity, glaring noticed when driving at night

Treatment: Surgery (phacoemulsification) = lens replaced
Risks = perforation causing retinal detachment, infection (enopthalmitis)</p><strong>Glaucoma</strong><br /><br /><p>= increased intra-ocular pressure leading to visual damage

RFs: FH, Female, Myopia (short sighted), African-Carribbean

Classification:
- Acute = rapid rise in IOP -> painful red eye and sudden reduction in acuity
- Chronic = gradual rise in IOP -> damage to optic nerve -> loss of acuity
- Primary
- Secondary = complication of other eye diseases that obstruct drainage e.g. inflammation, cataracts, haemorrhage, steroid use

Open/Closed angle:
refers to drainage angle where iris joins cornea and circulating fluid moves
- (Primary) Open angle = most common = reduced drainage through trabecular meshwork -> chronic glaucoma, characterised by peripheral before central visual loss
- (Primary) Closed angle = reduced drainage due to ageing lens pushing forward against the trabecular meshwork, usually presents acutely with sudden onset painful red eye and  altered vision = MEDICAL EMERGENCY

Clinical features:
- Often asymptomatic
- Raised IOP
- Disc cupping (optic disc is more cupped in glaucoma)
- Arcuate scotoma = area of diminished vision in visual field
- Tunnel vision

Management:
- Eye drops to alter droduction/drainage of aqueous humour in eye e.g. B blockers, prostaglandin analogues, myotics 
- Suegery - laser trabeculoplasty, trabeculectomy
- Management of acute closed angle glaucoma as emergency: eye drops, iridotomy (surgery where hole in iris is made)

Presentation:
Seen in 1/1500 births
Child may present with recurrent infections (infective endocarditis)
Can be found in adulthood presenting as cough/hypertension
May be seen on Xray as RVH

In an ASD, high pressure in LA forces blood through foramen into RA

But as pressure increases in R, it becomes higher pressure in R, forcing blood into L = Eisenmenger's syndrome -> cyanosis

Diagnosis:
1. Auscultation - fixed splitting of S2
2. ECG - prolongation of of PR interval (because atria is affected affecting p wave), axis deviation (cardiomegaly)
3. CXR - RVH, cardiomegaly (due to high pressure), enlarged pulmonary markings

Anaemia,"<p>B12 absorbed in stomach then bound to intrinsic factor which is produced by gastric parietal cells, so that it can be absorbed in the terminal ileum

Causes:
- Reduced intake (uncommon)
- Impaired absorption - Stomach problem (where intrinsic factor is produced) e.g. post-gastrectomy, Ileum problem e.g. Crohn's, ileal resection, pernicious anaemia

Pernicious anaemia:
= autoimmune attack of gastric parietal cells -> atrophic gastritis -> low intrinsic factor -> reduced absorption of iron
Other autoimmune diseases common e.g. thyroid, 
Pernicious anaemia predisposes to gastric adenocarcinoma
- Bloods: Low serum B12 on bloods, signs of macrocytic anaemia, autoantibodies - anti-parietal cell (90%), anti intrinsic factor (50%)
- Features: peripheral neuropathy (pins and needles, glove&stocking), can progress to subacute combined degeneration (loss of vibration, proprioception), then ataxia
- Treatment: hydroxycobalamin IM injection (=B12)</p><p>= Hb under 13.5 in men, 11.5 in women
Mostly asymptomatic
Anaemia is not a diagnosis, cause must be found

Symptoms:
If severe: lethargy, breathlessness,
Also symptoms of underlying disease/causes: e.g. angina, intermittent claudication

Signs:
Conjunctival pallor, koilonychia (spoon nails), atrophic glossitis, angular stomatitis, high flow murmur, tachycardia (due to compensatory hyperdynamic circulation)</p><strong>Inefficient production = Bone marrow infiltration (Aplastic anaemia)</strong><br /><br /><strong>Classification</strong><br /><br /><p>1mg iron required for normal adult - more in menstruation/pregnancy
Main store of iron = in red cells, also liver

Causes:
1. Reduced intake e.g. malnutrition
2. Increased demand e.g. pregnancy/puberty
3. Malabsorption - iron usually absorbed in duodenum e.g. Coeliac's, post-gastrectomy
4. Chronic blood loss - main store of iron is RBCs so when these are lost you become iron deficient, usually from uterus/upper GI tract

Blood results:
Low Hb, Low MCV, high ferritin, low serum iron, high total iron binding capacity (TIBC)
N.B. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant so if there is any inflammation/infection/malignancy then levels increase
Blood film: Microcytic, hypochromic cells, variation in cell size
Investigate for malignancy if suspected

Treatment - ferrous sulphate, parenteral iron if oral iron not tolerated</p><p>Usually caused by reduced B12 and folate - important in DNA synthesis in RBCs so you get small amounts of megaloblasts (large RBCs) with poor nuclear maturation if deficient
(But you can get non-megaloblastic anaemia (you don't get these poorly matured cells) due to alcohol, reticulocytosis, liver disease)

Blood film:
Macrocytic RBCs, hypersegmented neutrophils and low platelets</p><p>Microcytic: iron deficiency, thalssaemia, sideroblastic anaemia
Normocytic: acute blood loss, chronic disease, aplastic anaemia, haemolysis, pregnancy
Macrocytic: B12 and folate deficiency, alcoholism, hypothyroidism, liver disease

Problems which cause anaemia:
Insufficient production - elements needed to produce RBCs unavailable e.g. iron, B12, folate
Inefficient production - problem with machinery producing RBCs e.g. bone marrow infiltration, myelodysplasia (malignancy of early myeloid progenitor cells)
Increased destruction = Haemolysis</p><strong>Iron deficiency anaemia</strong><br /><br /><strong>Insufficient production 2: Macrocytic anaemia</strong><br /><br /><p>= bone marrow destruction/other cell line proliferating (myeloproliferation, malignancy) that competes with bone marrow
Cellular problem = other cells preventing bone marrow carrying out normal function e.g. myeloproliferation, myelofibrosis, malignancy

Bloods: Pancytopenia = anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia
Blood film: leukoerythroblastic = immature red/white cells
Hypocellular problem = amount of cells produced reduced e.g. idiopathic, cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy, infections (parvovirus B19, EBV, HIV), immune probs

</p><strong>Anaemia of chronic disease</strong><br /><br /><p>= Cytokine induced failure of transfer of iron from bone marrow to RBC blasts

Treatment: EPO SC injection, blood transfusions</p><strong>Vitamin B12 deficiency</strong><br /><br /><strong>Folate deficiency</strong><br /><br /><strong>Insufficient production 1: Microcytic anaemia</strong><br /><br /><p>Causes:
- Reduced intake common (spinach, broccoli, offal)
- Malabsorption e.g. Crohn's
- Increased demand e.g. pregnancy, myelofroliferation, other anaemias
- Drugs - anti-folate action e.g. methotrexate, alcohol, anticonvulsants
Bloods: Low red cell folate 
Treatment: Oral folate + B12, N.B. always give B12 with folate because if underlying B12 deficiency you can cause neuro symptoms</p><strong>Insufficient production 3: Normocytic anaemia</strong><br /><br /><p>Problem with anchoring proteins on cell membrane -> abnormal shape -> cells trapped in spleen -> splenic macrophages phagocytose the cells
Autosomal dominant
Spherocytosis = more common and severe, elliptocytosis = rare and mild
Blood film: Spherocytes/elliptocytes, osmotic fragility test

Features: Variable, sometimes no anaemia, sometimes chronic haemolytic anaemia with folate deficiency, possible to have acute haemolytic episodes -> aplastic anaemia (bone marrow probs)

Bloods: 
High uncon. bilirubin
Low haptoglobin (removes free Hb in bloodstream, so busy with haemolysis)
High LDH (released in tissue breakdown)
High urobilinogen
High reticulocytes (immature RBCs) + polychromasia (blue tinge to film)</p><strong>Increased destruction = Haemolytic anaemia</strong><br /><br /><p>Problems with RBC itself:

Blood film: Heinz bodies, bite cells
Diagnosis: Beutler flourescent spot test to measure G6PD in cells</p><strong>Sickle cell anaemia</strong><br /><br /><p>Pathophysiology:
= point mutation, rigid cells which can block small vessels
Crises precipitated by infection, dehydration, hypoxia
2 problems:
1. Shortened cell survival - chronic haemolysis
Features: splenomegaly (spleen is active so enlarges), gallstones (high conc of uncon. bilirubin), folate deficiency, vulnerable to aplastic anaemia
2. Vaso-occlusive disease - obstruction of small vessels -> infarction -> acute crises -> long term complications

Features of crises: 
- Bone pain + osteomyelitis (with salmonella infection)

- Priapism (unable to lose erection)
- Lower limb ulceration
- Retinopathy
- Tubulo-interstitial nephritis

Life threatening complications:
- Pulmonary syndrome (due to infection + fat embolism + sickle blockage) -> pulmonary hypertension
- Stroke

Diagnosis: Hb electrophoresis (single band of HbS), sickle solubility tests
Treatment of acute crisis: Treat precipitants e.g. infection
Prevention of complications: vaccination, penicillin prophylaxis, folic acid, hydroxyurea (slows course of disease)</p><p>Imbalanced alpha and beta globin chain production (2 types: alpha and beta)
2 problems:

Features (dependent on type): 
- Cardiac failure in utero (a)
- Splenomegaly (a)
- Severe anaemia early in life (B)/moderate/mild anaemia (a)
- Bony deformities (easy fractures) (B)
- Iron accumulation due to repeated blood transfusions -> failure of sexual development, diabetes (pancreatic probs), liver and heart probs (B)</p><p>Acquired mutation of stem cells -> RBC defect - affects all cell lines
Exception to rule as causes problem of RBC itself but is non-immune
Features: intravascular haemolysis, venous thrombosis (DVT, PE, stroke), haemoglobinuria (night/morning)

2 Types depending on the temperature at which the autoantibodies are reactive with the cells:
1. Warm (more common) - IgG mediated: 
Causes: Idiopathic, autoimmune disorders, myeloproliferative disorders (CLL, lymphoma), drugs (penicillin, methyldopa, quinine)
2. Cold - IgM mediated: Causes: Infections (EBV, mycoplasma), lymphoma

Clinical features: sometimes chronic anaemia, sometimes acute episodes

Lymphoma and Myeloma,"<strong>Management</strong><br /><br /><p>2 types:
1. Classical (95%) - 4 subtypes based on appearance of non neoplastic inflammatory infiltrate cells that appear around neoplastic lymphocytes
- a. Nodular sclerosing - occurs in younger people with mediastinum involvement
- b. Mixed cellularity - occurs in older people with peripheral involvement
- (c. Lymphocyte dominant)
- (d. Lymphocyte depleted)
2. Nodular lymphocytic (5%) - occurs in older people with inguinal node involvement

Pathognomonic feature = Reed-Sternberg cell = large binucleate cell

RFs: EBV, mononucleosis, immunosuppression, smoking</p><strong>Lymphoma</strong><br /><br /><strong>Physiology of lymphatic system</strong><br /><br /><p>Lymph nodes structure:
Collagenous capsule
Cortex - contains lymphoid follicles and B cell zone
Paracortex - T cell zone
Medulla - cords and sinuses come together to form the efferent lymphatic system that leaves the nodes, also arteries and veins come in here

Lymph comes from the outside of the capsule and leaves through the medulla
Germinal centres = where white cells are exposed and primed with antigens</p><p>= discrete tumour masses in lymph nodes or in extra-nodal locations
Hodgkin's (20%)/Non-Hodgkins (80%)</p><strong>Investigations</strong><br /><br /><strong>Causes of enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenitis)</strong><br /><br /><p>Usually benign and have many causes:
 - Infection e.g. minor infections
 - Inflammation e.g. HIV/lupus
 - Malignancy

Lymphadenitis can be:
Acute usually caused by infection
Chronic caused by:
- Follicular hyperplasia due to B cell activation e.g. HIV
- Paracortical hyperplasia due to T cell activation e.g. viral 
- Granular e.g. TB</p><strong>Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</strong><br /><br /><p>Normal B cell development:
Naive B cell encounters antigen -> lymphoid follicle where it undergoes a number of cellular changes
Malignant change is quite common at these stages as there is lots of genetic instability
Depending on which stage the B cell becomes malignant it causes different types of lymphoma

T cell NHL is rare but aggressive, 2 types:
- Cutaneous T cell lymphoma
- Enteropathy associated lymphoma (found in some Coeliacs)</p><strong>Classification</strong><br /><br /><p>High grade and aggressive - curable
- Burkitt's lymphoma (associated with Epstein-Barr virus)
- Diffuse large B cell lymphoma - come from centroblasts
- Mantle cell lymphoma - come from mantle zone

Low grade - less curable
- Small lymphocytic lymphoma
- Follicular lymphoma
- Marginal zone lymphoma</p><strong>Presentation</strong><br /><br /><p>Bloods: 
- FBC: low Hb, low platelets, low WCC
- U&E: renal probs, high Ca
- LFTs
- Serology: HIV, human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), hep C.
CXR: mediastinal adenopathy, pleural or pericardial effusions and parenchymal involvement.
Lymph node biopsy
CT scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis: for lymph nodes, hepatosplenomegaly
Bone scans
Bone marrow biopsy
</p><p>High grade - intensive chemo
Low grade - watch and wait strategy, 
 - Except gastric mucosa associated NHL due to chronic antigen stimulation (e.g. Sjogren's syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) treated with PPIs and antibiotics</p><strong>Hodgkin's Lymphoma</strong><br /><br /><strong>Presentation</strong><br /><br /><p>Bimodal (either in younger or older people)
Usually present with painless enlarged lymph node in lower neck/SC region
Systemic: fever, night sweats, weight loss, pruritis
Alcohol induced pain = rare but classical for HL
Mediastinal symptoms - cough, SVC obstruction, dysphagia, masses found on CXR</p><strong>Investigations</strong><br /><br /><p>Bloods: FBC, ESR raised, LFTs, HIV test
Lymph node biopsy
Staging with CT, bone marrow biopsy, other biopsies if other organs involved
CXR</p><p>Low-grade lymphomas: Painless, slowly progressive peripheral lymphadenopathy

Advanced disease:
Systemic: fever, night sweats, painful lymphadenopathy, fatigue
Can present at extranodal sites - CNS, skin, GI tract
Hepatosplenomegaly

Burkitt's lymphoms often presents with large abdo mass and symptoms of bowel obstruction</p><strong>Myeloma</strong><br /><br /><p>= haematological malignancy of plasma cells (responsible for production of antibodies) causing plasma cell proliferation -> bone marrow infiltration causing bone destruction and bone marrow failure</p><p>Bloods:
U&E - Impaired renal function, high Ca
FBC - Hb - normocytic normochromic anaemia, WCC low, platelets low, raised plasma viscosity, raised ESR
ESR - Raised due to end protein coats RBCs causing them to clump
Immunoglobulin levels

Abnormal electrophoresis - single monoclonal band of paraprotein, presence of Bence-Jones proteins

Confirmation of diagnosis:
Bone marrow aspirate +/- trephine biopsy.
Immunofixation of serum and urine to confirm and show the subtype of the paraprotein.
A skeletal survey.</p><strong>Diagnostic criteria</strong><br /><br /><strong>Investigations</strong><br /><br /><p>Important differential = monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance = paraprotein in blood but no myeloma</p><strong>Clinical Features</strong><br /><br /><p>Production of monoclonal immunoglobulin = paraprotein/IggM protein, by malignant plasma cells detectable in blood/urine 
Reduction in normal polyclonal immunoglobulins
30% have production by plasma cells of free light chains resulting in Bence-Jones proteins in urine</p><p>Characteristic clinical features:
1. Bone pain - usually backache, worse with activity
Caused by excessive stimulation of osteoclasts by plasma cells causing lytic lesions on XR, generalised osteoporosis, vertebral fractures causing back pain, can lead to SCC

2. Hypercalcaemia due to excess breakdown of bone causing:
Stones (renal or biliary)
Bones (bone pain)
Groans (abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, constipation)
Thrones (thirst, polyuria)
Psychiatric overtones (Depression 30-40%, confusion, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, insomnia, coma)
Also fatigue, anorexia, pancreatitis, abnormal heart rhythms

3. Anaemia - due to bone marrow infiltration by malignant cells -> normocytic normochromic anaemia
Infections due to immune paresis

4. Renal failure - Due to hypercalcaemia, also Bence-Jones proteins cause solid casts in distal nephrons, and some patients have light chain amyloidosis which can be deposited in kidney and can cause nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria)

5. Infections - pneumonias, pyelonephritis, due to immune deficiency

6. Neuro symptoms due to hypercalcaemia (weakness, confusion), hyperviscosity (headaches, visual disturbance), SCC (loss of bladder/bowel), infiltration of peripheral nerves by amyloid (carpal tunnel, neuropathies)

So common presenting symptoms are: backache, fractures, lethargy, anorexia, dehydration, recurrent bacterial infection, bleeding and/or bruising, nephrotic syndrome, hypercalcaemia (nausea, confusion etc).</p><p>Presentation usually over 60y
Sites that abnormal plasma cells seed: bone marrow, vertebra, ribs, skull</p><strong>Management</strong><br /><br /><p>Complex

Leukaemia,"<p>= more common in adults
Usually associated with another haem problem e.g. CLL, myeloproliferative disorder, chemo/radio
Involvement of lymph organs, but other organ infiltration rare
30% of AML patients will have Auer bodies in blast cells (pathognomonic)

Presentation: 
- Altered haematopoiesis
- Splenomegaly
- Skin involvement (in 10% raised non tender plaques = masses consisting of blasts)
- Hyperuricaemia (increased cell turnover causing renal impairment)
- Rarely: Hyperkalaemia due to potassium release from high WBC lysis), low glucose, high arterial O2 sats
- Hyperviscosity syndrome (spontaneous bleeding, headaches, retinopathy)</p><p>Chronic leukaemia = A malignant clone of mature cells which can differentiate in the early phase
Differentiation in stem cells but reduced proliferative capacity
Tends to get worse over time because mutations accumulate and cells become less well differentiated -> rapid proliferative overdrive -> acute leukaemia

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia - common in elderly

Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia:
1. Myeloproliferative disorders = if differentiation normal -> large number of normal myeloid cells produced, 
Number of disease states depending on which cell line is dominant:
- RBC - polycythaemia vera
- megakaryocyte - essential thrombocythaemia/idiopathic myelofibrosis
- neutrophil - CML
2. Myeloplastic syndromes (less known) = Ineffective differentiation -> developing myeloid cells dont differetiate properly and are destroyed in the bone marrow</p><p>= Monoclonal proliferation of small lymphocytes, mainly B cells
Small lymphocytes proliferate and spill into blood and migrate and seed in lymph nodes -> lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly -> bone marrow failure

Presentation: over 60y, more common in men, immunosuppression, bone marrow dysfunction, organ infiltration, lyphadenopathy, anaemia, thrombocytopenia
Usually diagnosed by incidental blood finding

Associated with autoimmune disease because of B cell probs (haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia) and reduced immunity due to lack of production of immunoglobulins (LRTI)

Blood film: lymphocytosis with mature lymphocytes, smear cells (abnormal lymphocytes which have been disrupted by smear process), reduced immunoglobulins
Marrow sample shows lymphocytic replacement of marrow

Early disease usually not treated (watch and wait)
Up to 5% of CLL can transform to resistant B cell lymphoma = Richter's syndrome
Advanced disease treated with supportive care (antibiotics), chemo, steroids and bone marrow transplant (if not too old)</p><p>Leukaemia = a type of cancer of the blood or bone marrow characterized by an abnormal increase of immature white blood cells called blasts 
Classification: Bone marrow origin/extra bone marrow origin/mixed</p><p>Extra bone marrow origin = Lymphoma = Malignancy of lymphocytes that have migrated to lymph nodes or other organs
Present with solid mass lesions
More common in B cells than T cells because they undergo hypermutation and genetic instability</p><p>Bone marrow origin = mutation in haematopoietic stem cell resulting in disrupted differaentiation and maturation of cells
Usually unknown cause - but associated with radiation and chemical exposure, genetics (Down's) and viruses 
Chromosomal abnormalities are common - karyotyping v important, 4 types:
Translocations, deletions, duplications, point mutations
Present with abnormal blood counts usually</p><strong>Polycythaemia Vera</strong><br /><br /><p>Mixed = Myeloma = Malignancy of plasma cells
Cells are terminally differentiated but hone back to bone marrow, so get features of bone marrow destruction due to cells overproliferating and peripheral involvement due to large quantities of immunoglobulins produced</p><strong>Chronic leukaemia</strong><br /><br /><strong>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia</strong><br /><br /><strong>Acute leukaemia</strong><br /><br /><strong>Chronic leukaemia 1. Myeloproliferative disorders</strong><br /><br /><strong>Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia</strong><br /><br /><strong>Acute myeloblastic leukaemia</strong><br /><br /><p>Acute leukaemia = malignant clone of immature undifferentiated blasts in bone marrow, they can proliferate but can't differentiate further

Pathology: Little differentiation in mutated stem cells -> undifferentiated/immature blasts in bone marrow -> cells have huge proliferative capacity -> overwhelm other marrow cells and spill out into blood

Diagnosis:
= over 20% blast cells in peripheral blood smear or bone marrow sample
Immunophenotyping - myeloid/lymphoid origin
Karyotyping - detects specific genetic mutations - for treatment susceptibility/prognosis

Management:
Supportive
Treat complications of bone marrow failure (blood products, antibiotics)
Chemo 
Stem cell transplant
In children: Induction (achieve remission), intensification (over 2 months to prevent relapse),prolonged maintenance therapy</p><p>= commonest leukaemia in children (peak age 4 years)
Organ infiltration with blasts is v. common, occurs at lymph sites, CNS or testes
Presents with uncontrolled growth of leukaemic cells, fatigue, easy bruising, bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy
Occurs less commonly in adults (20% of adult acute leukaemias)

Adverse prognostic factors in ALL: Male, age under 1 year or over 10years, or over 50y in adults, WCC over 15000, prolonged time to remission (over 4 weeks), philadelphia chromosome positive, hypodiploidy (under 45 chromosomes)</p><p>= excess proliferation of cells, full differentiation = loads of normal cells
Proliferation occurs down one line dominantly
Features: fibrosis, extramedullary haemopoiesis (splenomegaly), risk of transformation into acute leukaemia</p><p>Polycythaemia vera = increased production of RBCs (N.B. can also get increased WBCs and platelets)
1. Primary
2. Secondary due to chronic hypoxia (lung disease)/ abnormal EPO secretion (renal cell carcinoma, polycystic kidneys) - so ensure secondary causes are excluded on diagnosis

Presentation:
1. Hyperviscosity - headaches, visual disturbances, CV events (DVT, PE, MI), erythromylalgia (red painful extremities)
2. Increased histamine release - aquagenic pruritis, peptic ulcer

Investigations: 
Blood count (increased Hb and Hct, platelets? WCC?)
Blood smear
Bone marrow sample (increased erythroid cellularity and reticulin fibrosis)
Reduced serum EPO

Treatment:
- Reduce viscosity - under 45%, venosection/cytoreductive therapy (if platelets high)
Reduce thrombosis risk - aspirin and maintain platelets under 400

Prognosis: Usually live over 10y but may be transformation into leukaemia or myelofibrosis</p><p>Rare
Megakaryocyte myeloproliferation
But instead of releasing excess platelets there is a release of fibroblast stimulating factors -> excess stromal cells and fibrosis of bone marrow -> bone marrow failure -> massive extramedullary haematopoiesis -> hepatosplenomegaly

Presentation: Incidental, massive hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias due to marrow failure, presentation usually late

Investigations:
Blood film shows leukoerythroblastic picture (immature cells pushed into blood), teardrop quocliocytes (pathognomonic)
Bone marrow: dry tap, trephine shows prominent megakaryocyte hyperplasia, osteoscerosis, prominent collagen synthesis

Treatment:
Bone marrow transplant in young patients
Symptomatic - transfustions, cryoreductive therapy for high platelets (thalidomide)
Splenectomy can worsen this condition</p><strong>Chronic myeloid leukaemia</strong><br /><br /><p>= a myeloproliferative condition = overproduction of myeloid cells
Large numbers of differentiated neutrophils, have philadelphia chromosome (pathognomonic)

Chronic phase (months-5y), usually diagnosed here and controlled with meds
Accelerated phase = increase in immature blast cells)
Blast phase = transformation to acute leukaemia, not treatable, often first found here
These phases are diagnosed by high blast numbers and low platelet counts

Presentation: Middle aged men, symptoms of bone marrow infiltration, splenomegaly (if bad), abdo pain

Investigations:
Blood film: leukocytosis (raised WCC), presence of blasts, philadelphia chromosome positive, associated basophilia, normochromic normocytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelets)
Bone marrow: raised myeloid:erythroid ratio, presence of blasts, packed with granulocytic cells and basophils

Treatment:
Imatinib = tyrosine kinase inhibitor
Interferon = 2nd line if imatinib resistant/intolerant
Hydroxycarbamide can reduce malignant cell count and spleen size
Bone marrow transplant (curative)</p><strong>Chronic leukaemia 2. Myelodysplastic syndromes</strong><br /><br /><p>= malignant cells differentiate in a disordered manner, marrow cells forced to undergo apoptosis -> low peripheral blood counts (cytopenias)

Presentation: symptoms of anaemia, not usually organomegaly

Diagnosis:
- dysplastic blood cells - difficult to demonstrate this is due to a clonal disorder and not a nutritional disorder (e.g. B12, folate)

Treatment: Supportive (doesn't usually prolong survival), transplant, intensive chemo

Prognosis: progressive failure of bone marrow terminating in acute leukaemia</p><strong>Essential thrombocythaemia</strong><br /><br /><p>Hard to diagnose due to possibility of reactive thrombocytosis associated with inflammation, infection, neoplasia
Dominant cell line = megakarocytes -> sustained thrombocytosis

Presentation: often incidental, may be features associated with high platelets (venous/arterial theombosis, headaches, visual disturbance)

Investigations: Raised platelets, Marrow shows megakaryocyte abnormalities

Management:
Reduce thrombosis risk with aspirin

Diabetes Pharmacology,"<p>polypeptide hormone synthesised and released by B cells of pancreas
Insulin receptors on cell membranes

Effects on liver:
1. Reversal of catabolic reactions - inhibits gluconeogenesis, inhibits conversion of fatty acids and amino acids to ketoacids
2. Anabolic action - stimulates glycogen synthesis, increases triglyceride synthesis and VLDL formation

Effects on muscle:
1. Increased protein synthesis - increases amino acid transport and ribosomal protein synthesis
2. Increased glycogen synthesis

Effects on adipose tissue:
1. Increased triglyceride storage

Factors affecting insulin absorption and duration of action: injection site, blood supply, temperature, physical activity

Metabolism: 90% metabolic elimination (by insulinases in liver/kidney)

Adverse reactions:
- Hypoglycaemia: usually due to too high dose/meal not at right time/unexpected physical activity OR liver/kidney failure/infections
- Lipodystrophy
- Hypersensitivity</p><strong>Type 1 diabetes treatment</strong><br /><br /><p>Insulin must be used in type 1 to prevent acute complications (diabetic ketoacidosis) and chronic complications (peripheral neuropathies, retinopathies, nephropathies, atherosclerosis)

Can safely be combined with other hypoglycaemic agents inc. insulin
Given 2-3 times daily with breakfast
Proven to reduce complications

Adverse effects: 
1. GI - N+D+V
2. Lactic acidosis (tends to occur if also septic/renal impairment) - always think if acidotic patient on metformin who has been given IV contrast for a scan - because if the contrast medium causes kidney failure then there could be an accumulation of metformin causing a worse lactic acidosis - so metformin is stopped 48h before contrast
3. Vit B12 deficiency (decreased absorption)

Cystic Fibrosis,"<p>Autosomal recessive, multisystem disorder. Characterised by chronic respiratory tract infection and pancreatic enzyme insufficiency
1 in 25 are carriers, 1 in 2500 births, life expectancy is 30-40</p><p>Caused by mutations to CFTR gene (cyctic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)
Most common mutation of this gene is the deltaF508</p><p>CFTR = a glycoprotein found in epithelial cells of airways, ducts of pancreas, sweat glands, biliary system, vas deferens
Loss of function of the gene results in decreased secretion of Cl and increased reabsorption of sodium and water across epithelial cells --> reduced airway surface liquid --> viscous secretions in all areas above --> inhibits ciliary function --> chronic infection and inflammation --> lung damage</p><strong>Pathophys</strong><br /><br /><p>1. Pancreatic insufficiency:
Reduced bicarb secretion - disturbes optimal pH of pancreatic enzymes
Reduced water content of secretions
Plugging of ductules and pancreatic acini - often leads to pancreatitis

2. GI:
Reduced water and chloride secretion into gut - can cause newborn meconium ileus and distal intestinal obstruction
3. Liver:
Increased bile viscosity, plugging of biliary ductules
Obstructive cirrhosis, portal hypertnesion, hypersplenism
Gallstones, cholecystitis</p><p>4. Sweat glands: high sweat salt content due to failure of sodium and chloride reabsorption of sweat ducts

Renal Medicine,"<p>Often non-specific symptoms: malaise, fatigue, urinary symptoms
Features of underlying cause often more prominent</p><p>= Commonest cause of KIDNEY FAILURE
-> thickening of vessel walls (particular small vessels/arterioles) -> luminal narrowing
-> Chronic ischaemia -> Gradual loss of nephrons</p><p>Functions of kidney:
1. Excretion of waste
2. Acid base homeostasis
3. Hormone secretion - renin, erythropoietin, calcitriol
4. BP control through RAAS and ADH
4. Electrolyte balance (linked to BP control)

Kidney disease classification:
- Pre-renal (blood vessels)
- Renal (glomerulus, tubules, interstitium)
- Post-renal (outflow tracts)</p><strong>Pre-Renal: Blood flow & Blood vessels</strong><br /><br /><strong>Hypoperfusion</strong><br /><br /><strong>Hypertension</strong><br /><br /><p>Pre-renal problems ALMOST ALWAYS due to HYPOPERFUSION = V. common
- this means that not enough urine is produced for kidneys to function normally
- Usually reversible with fluids
- May lead to acute tubular necrosis if prolonged</p><p>Affects larger vessels typically renal arteries
Patient usually has RFs for atherosclerosis e.g. male, hypertension, FH, smoker, diabetic, high cholesterol
Disease is caused by narrowed arteries -> ischaemic nephropathy -> hypoperfusion -> loss of tubules
This causes secondary hypertension - body tries to respond to damage by activating RAAS -> all effects of hypertensive kidney failure -> chronic kidney disease

.
.</p><strong>Atherosclerotic renal disease: Renal artery stenosis</strong><br /><br /><strong>Acute Tubular Necrosis</strong><br /><br /><p>Primary - unknown cause
Secondary - another disease process causes it

Pathophys:
Damage to glomerulus -> loss of ultrafiltration -> leakage of protein and blood -> nephritic/nephrotic syndrome
About 5 different types which cause different amounts of leakage

Conditions that can cause glomerulonephritis: SLE, diabetes, amyloidosis, infections (malaria, hep B, strep), Wegener's vasculitis, malignancy, drugs</p><p>Acute:
Leads to acute renal failure
Due to a type 1 hypersensitivity response (mast cells, IgE)
Causes: Antibiotics (penicillin/cephalosporin), NSAIDs, Diuretics

Chronic:
Leads to chronic renal failure
Due to persistent inflammation and fibrosis 
Causes: NSAIDs</p><p>= an extreme complication of a UTI so particularly important in kids

Acute:
Person will be v. unwell with loin pain and UTI symptoms, may progress to renal failure if bilateral

Chronic:
Can become chronic if recurrent UTIs
Vesicoureteric reflux
If unilateral -> hypertension
If bilateral -> CRF in children</p><strong>Pyelonephritis</strong><br /><br /><p>= chronic hypoperfusion of kidneys -> ischaemia, irreversible
e.g. due to shock which isn't corrected
Pre-renal failure can cause long term renal failure due to ATN

Causes:
- Ischaemia = most common
- Drugs - gentamicin, contrast media in CTs
- Haemoglobin (malaria
- Myoglobin

N.B. other tubular disorders are v. rare
Due to excessive loss of substances/inadequate excretion of substances</p><strong>Interstitial Nephritis</strong><br /><br /><strong>Case 3: Chronic Post-renal Failure</strong><br /><br /><strong>Renal</strong><br /><br /><strong>Glomerulonephritis</strong><br /><br /><strong>Post-renal: Ouflow tract disease</strong><br /><br /><p>With post-renal (urology) think... It could one of 3 things: infections, stones or tumours
Can cause back-flow to kidneys -> loss of kidney function

Causes:
Stones
Malignancy - Bladder/ureter
Prostatic hypertrophy
Chronic urinary retention (neuro)
Retro-peritoneal fibrosis (inflammation and fibrosis behind ureters, causing them to tether and not drain properly)</p><p>= Persistent and irreversible reduction in renal function
5 stages based on GFR:
1. under 90
2. 60-90
3. 30-60
4. 15-30
5. under 15ml/min (end-stage) - needs dialysis

Causes: Anything that causes ARF can cause CRF if it goes on long enough
Most common 3 causes: 1. Diabetes 2. Hypertension 3. Glomerulonephritis

Multisystem disease:
- Nervous system: peripheral neuropathy, tiredness and fatigue (due to high urea causing encephalopathy), restless leg syndrome (due to uraemia)
- CV: Accelerated atherogenesis (common cause of death in CRF), fluid overload, uraemic pericarditis
- GI: Reduced calcium absorption (due to failure of production of calcitriol), altered taste
- Bones: Low calcium -> parathyroid responds -> hyperparathyroidism -> renal osteodystrophy, bone cysts
- Metabolic: Hyperkalaemia, acidosis, cramps
- Blood: Reduced EPO -> anaemia of chronic disease (normocytic), Impaired platelet function -> bruising

Apply that to lost functions of kidneys:
1. Excretion of waste -> uraemia ->tiredness, fatigue, encephalopathy, pericarditis
2. Acid base homeostasis -> acidosis
3. Hormone secretion - renin, erythropoietin, calcitriol -> low calcium -> renal osteodystrophy, bone cysts, low EPO -> anaemia, impaired platelet function, bruising
4. BP control through RAAS and ADH -> fluid overload, hypertension
4. Electrolyte balance (linked to BP control) -> hyperkalaemia
Other: neuropathy, atherogenesis, impaired platelet function

Management:
- Conservative - education, fluid restriction, avoid high potassium foods, Control CV risk: good diabetic control, good BP control, Dialysis
- Medical - Dialysis, Treat CV risk: Statin, Phosphate binders (renagel), Alfacalcidol (suppresses PTH), Recombinant EPO, Quinine (for cramps), Bicarb (acidosis)
- Surgical: Renal-replacement therapy</p><strong>Nephrotic Syndrome</strong><br /><br /><strong>Presentations of kidney disease</strong><br /><br /><p>1. Haematuria
2. Proteinuria (less than nephrotic)
3. Fluid overload (acute onset oedema which fills up lungs rather than peripheries)
Features: Brown urine due to blood
Causes: 
Adults: IgA nephropathy
Children: Post-strep glomerulonephritis</p><strong>Chronic renal failure</strong><br /><br /><strong>Case examples</strong><br /><br /><p>Really common
= Rapid loss of glomerular function over hours/days

This causes 4 problems:
1. Uraemia (high urea)
2. Failure of fluid balance -> fluid overload (pul oedema)
3. Failure of electrolyte regulation (hyperkalaemia)
4. Failure of acid-base regulation (acidosis)

Causes:
- Pre-renal - hypoperfusion
- Renal - glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, tubulopathy
- Post-renal - obstruction
ARF can become CRF (due to acute tubular necrosis in chronic hypoperfusion)
Features: vague

Investigations:
- Bloods - FBC, U&E (look for hyperkalaemia, high urea and creatinine), ABG (acidosis), autoantibodies, lipids, CRP, LFT
- Cultures - urine (protein, blood, infection), blood
- Imaging - CXR (for pul oedema), AXR (stones), US (to look at kidneys)
- Scopes - renal biopsy if undiagnosed
- Functional - ECG (signs of hyperkalaemia)

Treatment:
Give fluids to treat hypoperfusion but only after you've treated the complications because they will kill you quicker
1. Treat complications
- Hyperkalaemia (urgent treatment) - calcium gluconate (to protect myocardium), insulin and dextrose (to get rid of potassium)
- Pulmonary oedema (diuretics)
- Acidosis (Bicarb with caution - only given by specialists, dialysis if refractory)
2. Treat underlying cause
- Pre-renal - fluids
- Renal - Immunosuppression (steroids)
- Post-renal - relieve obstruction, nephrostomy (tube to relieve pressure)
3. Dialysis

Indications for dialysis:
1. Complication of uraemia - encephalopathy, pericarditis
2. Refractory hyperkalaemia
3. Refractory fluid overload
4. Anuria</p><strong>Case 2: Post-strep Glomerulonephritis</strong><br /><br /><strong>Acute renal failure</strong><br /><br /><p>35yo, alcohol abuser, presents with confusion and malaena

Adaptations at Birth,"<strong>Foetal life</strong><br /><br /><p>Lungs filled with amniotic fluid -> no gas exchange
High pulmonary vascular resistance -> blood vessels supplying lungs constricted -> low blood supply to lungs
Low resistance in placenta -> high flow of blood through placenta
Ductus arteriosus -> only small amount of blood flows into lungs

Blood flow in umbilical cord:
Umbilical vein carries oxygenated blood
Umbilical artery carries deoxygenated blood</p><strong>Foramen</strong><br /><br /><p>1. Ductus arteriosus (connects pul artery to aorta) -  Due to high pul vascular resistance, blood from R side bypasses lungs due to ductus arteriosus
2. Foramen ovale connects L atria and R atria reducing blood flow to lungs
3. Ductus venosus shunts umbilical vein blood to IVC bypassing the liver

These things increase the amount of oxygenated blood reaching the foetus</p><strong>at birth</strong><br /><br /><p>During labour things happen to reduce fluid in lungs to allow breathing:
- Lung liquid production reduced
- Infants chest squeezed -> lung liquid drained
- Increased catecholamine levels -> stimulates breathing
- Breathing stimulates absorption of remaining lung fluid

Umbilical cord clamped which closes foramen:
- Venous return to RA from placenta reduced
- Rise in LA pressure from increased pul venous return
- Low RA pressure closes foramen ovale
- Ductus venosus closes due to reduced umbilical venous return

Lung expansion:
-> Rise in oxygen levels
- Lung aeration causes decreased pul vascular resistance
-> pul blood flow increases
- Flow of oxygenated blood closes ductus arteriosus

Basic Arrhythmias,"<strong>Tachycardias</strong><br /><br /><p>SVT = above AV septum, VT = below</p><p>SVT - narrow complex, VT - broad complex (over 0.12s)</p><p>SVT plus BBB = also broad complex (because there is a problem of ventricular conduction)</p><p>BBB: 
RBBB: R (small +ve) S (deep -ve) R in V1 - looks like an M
LBBB: RSR (M shape) in V6
BBBs make it difficult to interpret the rest of the ECG</p><strong>Ventricular tachycardias</strong><br /><br /><p>VF: a child's scribble, v. serious, not compatible with CO because ventricles aren't contracting</p><p>VT: regular wide QRS pattern. Can be pulseless (no CO) but usually pulse is present</p><strong>SV tachycardias</strong><br /><br /><p>Irregular: AF</p><p>Regular: sinus tachycardia, AVNRT (AV nodal reentrant tachy), AVRT</p><p>Sinus tachycardia = a normal fast heartbeat. Can be caused by exercise, stress, also hypovolaemia</p><p>AVNRT = additional pathway in AV node, keeps circling back to the node meaning that the ventricular system keeps firing</p><p>AVRT = accessory pathway, impulse goes straight back up to atria, also continual firing of ventricles. 
Most common example = WPW, re-entrance bundle = bundle of Kent
Short PR and slurred up to QRS = delta wave</p><p>Treatment of SVTs:
Rate control - if it's fast, slow it down
Conservative - valsalva manuveur, carotid pressure
Medical - adenosine, DC cardioversion (if low BP, chest pain, low consciousness, pulmonary oedema - so unstable)</p><strong>AF</strong><br /><br /><p>Causes: 
cardiac - ischaemic heart disease, valve disease (mitral)
Non-cardiac - alocohol, thyrotoxicosis, pneumonia</p><p>Complications of AF: emboli, reduced CO, tachycardia</p><p>Treatment:
Rate control - requires anticoagulation, B blockers, CA blockers, digoxin
Rhythm control - no anticoagulation needed as problem is cured, use DC cardioversion or drugs (amiodarone/flecainide)
Anticoagulation - Warfarin, or aspirin if contraindicated</p><p>Management rules of pt with sudden onset palpitations and suspect AF:
under 48h - cardioversion as small clot risk (e.g. with alcohol as the cause)
over 48h - rhythm/rate control + anticoagrulation
</p><strong>Bradycardias</strong><br /><br /><p>Failure of impulse generation or impulse generated fails to conduct</p><p>Failure of impulse generation = sick sinus syndrome (disease of elderly with fibrosis of SA node) causes long pauses between P waves
</p><p>Failure of impulse conduction = AV blocks - 1st-3rd degree heart block

Cranial Nerves,"<strong>I</strong><br /><br /><p>Loss of taste and smell
Can be permanent or temporary.
The reason it happens is you damage or block the nerves where they exit the cribriform plate.
Testing done with specific smells- use your initiative.</p><strong>II</strong><br /><br /><p>Remember the lesions diagram, with the crossing over of the optic nerves.
Images coming in from your temporal side hit the nasal retina, and the images coming from the nasal side hit the temporal retina.
1. monocular blindness- diabetes, syphilis, arteritis, MS
2. bitemporal hemianopia- the two nasal sides of the retina converge at the optic chiasm- pituitary adenoma
3. homonymous hemianopia- (on the same side) eg the nasal field of L and the temporal field of R, coming from nasal side of R retina and temporal side of R retina- stroke or tumours beyond the optic chiasm

</p><strong>III, IV, VI</strong><br /><br /><p>all three of these nerves deal with eye movements. remember to also check pupil relexes (see diagram) and remember accomodation. When checking the pupils you will get a response from the eye you shine the light in (afferent-arriving) from the optic (II) nerve, and the other eye will also respond (efferent-exiting) from the oculomotor (III). Eg when you shine a light in the R eye and it doesnt react and your left eye does it shows you that the efferent on the R side isnt working.</p><strong>Pupillary dilatation</strong><br /><br /><p>Myotonic pupil- holmes-zadies pupil

Liver Pathology 1,"<strong>Basics</strong><br /><br /><p>Due blood supply from portal vein and hepatic artery. 
Functions include: metabolic, synthetic, storage and detoxification</p><strong>Hepatic failure</strong><br /><br /><p>>90% reduction in functional capacity
1. acute - sudden, massive insult on normal liver
2. decompensated - minor insult on a heavily damaged liver
Leads to hepatic encepalopathy - accumulation of toxins within the brain, severe coagulopathy - reduction in clotting factors (often bleeding disorder with increased INR), jaundice - conugated billirubin. 
If decompensated - signs of chronic liver disease e.g. palmar erythema, spider naevi, spleenomegoly, ascites. 
Associated with hepatopulmonary and hepatorenal syndrome.</p><strong>3 stages previous to hepatic failure</strong><br /><br /><p>1. Acute Liver Disease
Damage resolved within 6 months
Caused by infections, drugs, alcohol. 
Signs and symptoms variable. 
Can lead to icteric hepatitis -> characterised by two stages:
(a) prodrome - fever, abdo pain and systemically unwell.
(b) jaundice (+/- pruritis)

2. Chronic Liver Disease (important to find cause)
Persists >6 months
80% asymptomatic, 15% symptoms, 5% unresolved icteric hepatitis. 

3. Cirrhosis
Only small fraction of people with chronic liver disease will develop cirrhosis.
Whole liver fibrosis with nodules of regenerating hepatocytes and disruption to the liver vascular architecture. 
- Injury causes cytokine realease from Kupfer cells which activate Stellate cells which produce collagen. 
Classified by aetiology e.g. alcohol/hepatitis

Complications:
(i) Portal hypertension - increased resistance to blood flow within the liver causing spleenomegaly and portosystemic anatamoses e.g. varices and caput medussa. 
(ii) Hepatocellular carcinoma - from regenerating hepatocytes. 

Stigmata of chronic liver disease/cirrhosis = clubbing, palmar erythema, dupytrens, asterixis, spider naevi, caput medussa. 
Ascites and jaundice may indicate decompensation -> hepatic failure. </p>",5913,4,25,2012-12-31 15:49:45 UTC,2012-12-31 15:49:45 UTC
Liver Function Test,"<p>Crude tests but can help to distingush existance, extent and type of liver disease.</p><strong>Gamma GT</strong><br /><br /><strong>Serum Markers</strong><br /><br /><strong>ALT and AST</strong><br /><br /><p>Serum markers indicated liver cell damage e.g. the transamminases: ALT, AST, gamma-GT, ALP. </p><p>Aminotranferases: contained in hepatocytes and involved in amino acid metabolism, raised in hepatocyte death. 
Normal range: 0-50units/L
>1000units/L has three main causes:
1. ischemia i.e. hypoperfusion 2. viruses (hepB) 3. toxins (paracetamol OD)
- Both present in small amounts in other tissues
- AST rises more than ALT in alcohol/cirrhosis problems.</p><p>Mircosomal enzyme in hepatocytes and bile ducts, involved in amino acid metabolism. 
Useful alongside ALP (which is found in other tissues) to specify liver damage. 
- Significantly raised in alcohol abuse, even in absence of liver damage. </p><strong>ALP</strong><br /><br /><p>(normal range: 40-150)
Found in sinisoidal/canilicular membranes within the liver
Elevated in cholestasis which can be:
1. intrahepatic - liver damage
2. extrahepatic - obstruction along billary tree
Other sources; bone, placenta and kidneys.</p><strong>Practically...</strong><br /><br /><p>- Useless breakdown product from haemoglobin which occurs in the spleen. 

1. forms unconugated billirubin from spleen and bound to albumin
2. hepatocytes take up unconug. billirubin and gluconyl-transferase catalyses binding of glucoronic acid forming conugated billirubin (called conugation)
3. conugated billirubin is water soluable and realeased into bile
4. duodenum: gut bacteria reduce it to stercobillinogen and then eliminated in faeces.
5. small amount secreted by kidneys as urobillinogen. 

Normally, no conugated billirubin found in blood. 
However, in liver/billary disease some escapes into plasma and filtered by kidneys into urine giving it a characteristic dark colour (billirubinuria always pathological), associated with pale stools thru lack of stercobillinogen. 

Jaundice sign from hyperbillirubinaemia (yellow discolouration of skin and sclera) but doesn't occur until billirubin levels significantly raised. 

CAUSES:
1. prehepatic - increased production of billirubin e.g. haemolysis because its unconugated it's not excreted by kidneys therefore urine normal. 
2. hepatocellular - impaired uptake/conugation occurs as part of disease of hepatocytes. Excessive billirubin both unconug/conug. so urine may darken slightly.
Gilberts syndrome: inherited condition with reduced activity of gluconyl-transferase characterised by intermitent episodes of mild jaundice. 
3. obstructive - blockage to flow of bile, can occur at any level in billary tree.
Causes: gallstones in common bile duct, carcinomas of the head of pancreas or extrahepatic bile duct. 
Leads to dark urine and pale stools. Pruritis (itching) occurs earlier than jaundice. </p><strong>Pro-thrombin time</strong><br /><br /><p>Clotting factor produced by the liver, therefore when damage, reduction in clotting factors and increase in pro-thrombin time. 
- Shorter half life, so indicative of acute/early liver damage. </p><strong>Billirubin</strong><br /><br /><strong>Albumin</strong><br /><br /><strong>Function Markers</strong><br /><br /><p>Bilary damage:
ALP > AST and ALT
Hepatocyte necrosis:
AST and ALT > ALP</p><p>Major synthetic product of liver (accounts for 50% of output)
Responsible for oncotic pressure and binding within the blood e.g. steriods. 
- Marker of chronic liver disease as it has a long half life. </p>",5913,4,,2012-12-31 15:49:45 UTC,2012-12-31 19:16:07 UTC
Pathology of the Small Intestine,"<p>Most important conditions:

Large Bowel Pathology,"<p>Role of the large intestine is to absorb water/electrolytes to form stools. 
Main conditions affecting the bowel are:
infection, inflammation and tumours.
Obstruction can occur with absolute constipation, and late onset vomitting (low level obstruction). Caused by, tumours, diverticular strictures or sigmoid volvulus (twist on mesentary, often seen in elderly)</p><strong>Infection</strong><br /><br /><p>Infectious colitis. 
Causes dysentry - fever, cramping abdo pain with puss/blood in stools. 
Shigella (UK) - gram -ve bacteria invades epithelium causing ulceration. Severe cramps with watery then bloody stools. 
Protozoa (tropical) - Similar to shingella. Diagnosis through presence of cysts within stool sample. 
C.Diff (hospital) - Caused by toxin, normal commensal organism but overgrows following broad spectrum Abx. Anaerobic requiring metronidazole. </p><strong>Inflammation</strong><br /><br /><p>Ulcerative Colitis - inappropriate immune response to normal gut bacteria. 
Distingushed from Crohns as only effects the colon (always involves the rectum) and continuous, whilst only affecting the mucosal layer. 
Bloody diarrhoea (alongside tenesmus and urgency) is indicative of active UC, no symptoms when inactive.
Mucosa - granular, velvet appearance and polyps. Diffuse inflammation in mucosa. Crypt architecture distortion and abesseses (neutrophils).
Toxic megacolon - severe UC causes inflammation and atrophy of muscle cells causing dilated segment. 
Sequelae - perforation and carcinoma.</p><strong>Tumours</strong><br /><br /><p>Colorectal adenocarcinoma - 2nd most common cancer in UK, with majority found in rectum or sigmoid colon. 
Big risk factor is low fibre diet as slow colonic transit increases exposure to carcinogens. 
Develop from adenomas (dysplastic neoplasms w/ malignant potential)
APC gene (tumour suppresor) indicated. 
Size, villous histology, and dysplasia associated with increased risk of transformation to adenocarcinoma. 
Only cancerous when breaks thru mucularis mucosa (not basement membrane) as no potential for spread until in submucosa. 
Presentation: change in bowel habit, abdo pain. 
Screening through faecal occult blood. 
Polyps:
1. adenomas
2. inflammatory
3. hyperplastic (majority in rectum/colon) - low risk of malignant change. </p><strong>Diverticulosis</strong><br /><br /><p>Presence of diverticulum whereas diverticulitis is inflammation of diverticulum which is a pouch of colonic mucosa herniating through circular muscular layer. 
Caused by:
1. raised intraluminal pressure (low fibre diet)
2. weakness in muscle wall (eg. blood vessel track)
Presentation mimicts adenocarcinoma. 
Sequelae: acute diverticulitis (left iliac fossa pain) -> perforation, fistula (bladder) or absess. Acute gastrocolonic bleeding. </p>",5913,4,,2012-12-31 15:49:45 UTC,2012-12-31 19:16:07 UTC

Complications: 
1. Peptic stricture
- Scarring and deformation -> narrowing
2. Barretts oesophagus
- Columnar metaplasia and precursor to adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus. However, dysplasia must occur first, leading to malignant but no basement membrane invasion. Pt's should be entering into screening.

H.PYLORI  
Gram âve bacteria with flagellum survives in the antrum as least acidic. Urease enzyme allows ammonia from urea within mucus. 
Major factor â acidity
Normal secretors (80%) â asymptomatic pan-gastritis
Hypersecretors â duodenitis and ulceration. Duodenum then metaplases which is counterproductive as H.pylori can then colonise causing ulcers)
Hyposecretors â acute gastritis leading to chronic atrophic gastritis as inflammation further suppresses acid secretion. Gastric metaplasia to intestinal epithelium is a marker of gastrocarcinoma.
AUTOIMMUNE â destruction of parietal cells (acid producing) located in body thus inflammation is seen here [differentiates from H.pylori which is in the antrum] and metaplasia and pernicious anaemia (intrinsic factor secretion)
CHEMICAL â NSAIDs or alcohol
EROSIVE/HAEMORRHAGIC â stress ulceration (heals rapidly)</p><p>1. Cardia - where oesophagus joins body of the stomach 
2. Fundus - section above the gastro-oesophageal junction
3. Body - Most of stomach
4. Antrum - next to pylorus
Protection through mucus layer, bicarbonate ions and blood flow to wash out acid. </p><strong>Achalasia</strong><br /><br /><p>1. Squamous cell (squamous differentiation)

Presentation: (and prognosis poor)
- Malaise and weight loss
- Progressive dysphagia (solids then liquids then own secretions)</p><p>Often secondary to background gastric disease i.e. PUD or H.pylori
Adenocarcinoma
(a)	Intestinal â inflammation, metaplasia and dysplasia sequence and associated with H.pylori
(b)	Diffuse â normal mucosa and signet ring cells (high intracellular mucin pushing nucleus to one side) highly infiltrive covering stomach
Lymphoma 
No lymphoid tissue normally however H.pylori cause B-cell hyperstimulation and migration causing marginal cell lymphoma -> responds to antibiotics!

Hypertension,"<p>AB*CD- Ace inhibitor, Beta blockers, Calcium channel inhibitor, Diuretics.
* beta  blockers are not used as much with thiazides because can exacerbate diabetes.
AB- <55, white ppl
CD- >55, black ppl
if all else fails after adding ABCD, consider spironolactone and alpha antagosist</p><p>key figure: 140/90

secondary hypertension - endocrine disease(cushings, conn's, noraderaline secreting tumour, pregnancy (pre-eclampsia), not taking bp tablets...</p><p>investigations: 
renal: proteinuria, haematuria, blood test (U&Es), raised creatinine, renal ultrasound to show size n location of kidneys.

Cushings and conn's can see common electrolyte derrangement - hypokalaemia and hypernatraemia. potassium and sodium change due to x/s glucocorticoids.
Cushing's syndrome (presence of large amounts of steroids) rather than Cushing's disease which is disease of pituitary.

Cushing's syndrome - urinary free cortisol
Conn's- raised plasma aldosterone, reduced plasma renin.
Pheochromocytoma's- urinary VMA
</p><p>Uncontrolled HTN- chronic kidney disease failure</p><p>Should you treat bp? 
24 hrs monitoring and depending of the patient's risk

Risks that require ttx?
1.cardiovascular risk >10 yrs, look at tables
2. existing vascular disease (PVD,heart disease)
3. Target organ damage (retinopathy, renal failure) - 
treat to 140/90

How to work out the risk-
back of BNF chart- gender, cholesterol, age, smoker or not, systolic, ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol.
Used only for primary prevention! thus not applicable to diabetics etc because they already have the disease.

</p><p>Do not use heparin initially as when just had ischemic stroke, more likely to get haemorrhagic one too. Can used TED stockings instead.</p><p>Suitability for thrombolysis:
1.within 3 hrs

HYPERTENSION thickening of vessel walls (small muscular arteries) = luminal narrowing = less flow = chronic ischaemia = loss of nephrons = kidney failure ATHEROSCLEROSIS renal disease renal artery stenosis - pts usu have hgh cholesterol, smoker etc pts do not get enough o2 to kidneys pts can get secondary hypertension (RAA renin angiotensin alodsterone-mediated)</p><strong>RENAL</strong><br /><br /><p>GLOMERULAR DISEASE
= 'knot' of capillaries that projects into Bowman's capsule
this is the site of ULTRAFILTRATION - site where solute of the blood is filtered

GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
= injury +/- inflammation of glomeruli

can be primary or secondary
if damaged = loss of filtration = leakage of protin and blood
secondary causes: lupus, DM, amyloidosis, infections, vasculitis, malignancy, drugs

TUBULAR DISEASE
site of further filtration / absorption
Acute tubular necrosis! - most common

causes: occurs w/ ischaemia (prolonged loss of perfusion) - therefore pre-renal failure can cause renal failure (ATN)
toxins: myoglobin, drugs - gentamicin + contrast media!

INTERSTITIAL DISEASE: Interstitial nephritis
can be divided into acute and chronic


acute: always due to type 1 hypersensitivity response due to ABs (penicillin, cephlosporins), NSAIDs (persistant inflammation) + diuretics

PYELONEPHRITIS
= extreeme UTI - gone into kidney
ACUTE: ascending infection 
unwell pt
loin pain + dysuria
renal failure

CHRONIC
esp in kids who have repeated UTIs

>Blood Supply: Axillary, Internal thoracic, Intercostal arteries. Venous supply is corresponding.
>Lymph - Axillary, internal mammary and supra-clavicular. Only way to assess internal mammory nodes is CT scan. Axillary LN made up of 5 groups.</p><strong>Investigations</strong><br /><br /><p>TRIPLE ASSESSMENT:
1) Clinical - Hx / Ex
2) Radiology
3) FNA cytology

>History - Change in size, lumps, pains, nipple discharge. Any other associations - nipple retraction, skin change, bone pain. PMH - any previous breast problems. FH - important (genes and relatives) DH - pill, HRT. Oestrogen exposure history is important.
>Ex: Remember to examine LNs, liver and feel for spiny tenderness
>Radiology:
USS - useful <35. Breasts too dense for mammography.
Mammography (2 views used) - 10% FN rate.
>Cytology
FNA - 95% sensitivity, easy to do. If positive or in doubt - Core Biopsy / Tru-Cut (can be sent for histology, and oestrogen receptor status).</p><strong>Benign Breast Disease</strong><br /><br /><p>CONGENITAL:

>Amastia (absence of breast and nipple), hypoplasia 
>Accessory Nipples - failure of primitive milk line (runs vertically down) to regress; excise if problematic.

ACQUIRED:

HORMONAL - tend to be cyclical.  
>Benign Mammary dysplasia (pre-menopausal, painful, nodular lump in upper outer quadrant). Always investigate further is suspicious.
>Cystic Disease - approaching menopause, cysts containing green / brown fluid. If persists or blood stained fluid - FNAC +/- USS.  
>Fibroadenoma - 'breast mouse'. Firm smooth mobile masses often found in young. Tend to follow cycle of women. Often regress.

INFECTIVE CAUSES:
>Lactational Mastitis - staph infected cracked nipple from breast feeding - can lead to abscess.
>Non-lactational Mastitis - again staph causes, can cause peri-ductal mastitis (mastalgia, nipple retraction, and discharge) Rx: analgesia and Abx (flucloxacillin)

INFLAMMATORY:
>Duct Ectasia - duct dilatation, produces cheesy, bloody stained discharge.
>Fat Necrosis - often post trauma - leads to fibrosis and calcification - can progress to cancer.

BENIGN NEOPLASMS:
>Duct Papilloma - 35 - 50yrs, presents with blood stained discharge. Rx: Microdochectomy, or complete duct excision.
>Lipoma</p><strong>Breast Cancer</strong><br /><br /><p>Common 1:11, increases with age, western populations.
RFs:

>prolonged / high oestrogen exposure (early menarche, late menopause, exogenous hormones 
>FHX - CA in first degree relative - BRCA1 (also ovarian) and BRCA 2 genes 
>1st child over 30 years.</p><p>Tumour Types:

>Ductal vs Lobular (both go through non-invasive CIS). 
>Others include medullary, mutinous and papillary, and Paget's disease (looks like eczema, if nipple eczema persists > 2 weeks - needs investigation.)

>Early Disease.
4 basic aims:
Local treatment of tumour, axillary clearance, prevent recurrence and reconstruct. Local treatments include WLE + radiotherapy or mastectomy (Often for large, central masses, or if unable to undergo radiotherapy. Both have same survival, but less recurrence with mastectomy).
Axillary Management - SLNB, clearance of involved LN (done at 3 levels, depend on level with pec minor)
Recurrence prevention: Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy (recurrence, large tumours, young), Hormonal - Tamoxifen - depends on oestrogen receptor status (ER+), Aromatase inhibitors.
Reconstruction - TRAM flap, Lat Dorsi flap, implants, tattoo (for nipples)

>Advanced Disease
Tamoxifen first line.
Local Recurrence - furtehr excision, radiotherapy
Metastatic Dx: bisphosphonates, steroids, analgesia, anti-emetics
Palliative: Analgesia, Radiotherapy, support package
Often multi-modal.

Cystic Fibrosis,"<p>Autosomal recessive condition 
Multisystem disorder: chronic respiratory tract infection and pancreatic enzyme insufficiency
1 in 2500 live births 
Life expectancy: 30-40 years 
CF is caused by mutations to the CFTR gene (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene)
Most common mutation = delta F508  accounting for 76% affected in the UK 
CFTR is a glycoprotein with 1480 amino acids. This protein is found in the epithelial cells of the airways, ducts of the pancreas, sweat glands, biliary system and vas deferens. 
Protein has five domains, two membrane spanning domains, each connecting to a nucleotide binding fold inside of the cytoplasm and a single regulatory R domain. 
Function: chloride channel activated by phosphorylation of hte R domain and ATP.
Activation results in opening of the chloride channel and closure of the sodium channels. 
Loss of function results in decreased secretion of chloride and increased resorption of sodium. 

Pathogenesis of CF:
- Loss of function of CFTR gene: decreased secretion of chloride and increased reabsorption of sodium and water across the epithelial cells .
- This results in viscous secretions in respiratory tract, pancreas and GI tract, sweat gland and other exocrine tissues. 
- In respiratory tract: reduced Cl secretion and increased Na reabsorption leads to airway surface liquid reduced, viscous mucus produced, this inhibits ciliary function and leads to chronic infection and inflammation which leads to the lung damage seen in CF
- Pancreatic insufficiency: reduced bicarbonate secretion leads to reduced water content of secretions which plugs ductule and pancreatic acini.
- GI tract: reduced water and chloride secretion into gut which can cause meconium ileus (newborn, may be presentation of CF) and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome
- Liver: increased bile viscosity and plugging of biliary ductules, obstructive cirrhosis, portl hypertension, hypersplenism, gallstones, cholecystitis. 
- Sweat glands: high sweat salt is seen due to failure of chloride and sodium reaborption from sweat ducts 
- Vas deferens: most males are azoospermic due to agenesis of vas deferens. mild mutations of CFTR can cause isolated congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens 

Clinical features:
- failure to thrive
- Recurrent chest infections
- Steatorrhoea
- 10% present with meconium ileus as a newborn 
- Respiratory: recurrent chest infection, cough, atypical asthma, wheezing, recurrent sinusitis, nasal polyps
- GI etc:
   Neonatal: meconium ileus, intestinal atresia, delayed passage of meconium, jaundice
   Infant/children: failure to thrive, flatulence, recurrent abdo pain,  malabsorption, rectal   prolapse 

O/E:
- sinusitis, nasal polyps, clubbing, cough, increased AP diameter of chest, crackles, tachypnoea, recession, wheeze
- malnutrition, anaaemia, dry skin (vit A deficiency), skin rash (zinc def), abdo distension, hepatosplenomegaly, rectal prolapse 

Investigations:
- Diagnosis based on sweat test - minimum of 100mg sweat should be collected
   Negative (normal) = Cl < 40 mmol/l
   Borderline = Cl 40-60 mmol/l
   Positive = Cl > 60 mmol/L
False positives may occur with adrenal insufficiency, ectodermal dysplasia, glycogen storage disease and familial hyperparathyroidism. 
Dx can also be made by DNA analysis: CFTR anallysis for delta 508 and up to 30 other mutations Account for 90% of all CF mutations. 
Negative results reduce chance of CF but does not exclude it 

Baseline investigations in a child diagnosed with CF:
- CXR: hyperinflation, peribronchial thickening and then progress to patchy infiltration and bronchiectasis 
- Sputum culture: staph aureus, pseudomonas or klibsiella 
- Blood test: FBC, coagulation, immunoglobulins, renal and liver 
- Vitamin levels: A, D and E 

Management: respiratory
- physiotherapy to aid airway clearance of thick mucus 
- Antibiotics: prophylactic (flucloxacillin) and treatment of acute infection
- Mucolytics (DNAase): increases mucociliary clearance and increases lung function 
- Bronchodilators and steroids are sometimes of benefit if there is bronchial hyperreactivity with reversible airways obstruction present in 30% of CF patients 

Nutritional managment:
- Creon: needed in patients with pancreatic insuffiency
- PPI needed to compensate for defective pancreatic bicarbonate secretion and also increases efficacy of Creon 
- Vitamin supplements: ADEK
- Diet: high fat, high calorie (increased energy requirements as well as fat malabsorption)

Complications:
- GI: distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, hepatic cirrhosis, cholecystitis, gallstones
- Resp: haemoptysis, co pulmonale
- Metabolic: DM, bone disease
- Reproducive: delayed puberty, reduced fertility
- Psychological impact of having such a serious chronic disease

Prenatal diagnosis with a FH and carrier screening if affected child
Newborn screening: all infants guthrie spot test for immunoreactive trypsinogen . Mutationanalysis is offered to infants with an IRT > 99.5th centile.

Gastroenteritis and Dehydration in Kids,"<p>gastroenteritis = inflammation of stomach and intestine
diarrhoea with or without vomiting (sudden onset)
enteric virus is the usual cause although can also be caused by bacterial or protozoal infections.
the main viral cause is rotavirus (60%), also enteric adenovirus and norwalk agents. think of the viral causes against bacterial as they present slightly differently.
bacterial: salmonella, campylobacter, shigella, e.coli. 
bacterial causes are more common in children < 2 years. Both bacterial and viral are transmitted via faeco-oral route although bacterial can also be caught by food e.g. meat. 
Both cause vomiting and diarrhoea, fever dehydration and disturbances and electrolyte. 
The difference is that bacterial causes cause dysentry, malaise and tenesmus. 
Viral causes may also be associated with URTI signs (especially rotavirus) and the diarrhoea tends to be more watery without the blood and mucus. 
Remember that a number of disorders in children can masquerade as gastroenteritis e.g. meningitis, septicaemia, dka and lots of surgial disorders can also cause diarrhoea and vomiting. if in doubt, admit patient. 

Clinical assessment:
- Need to assess dehydration: can lead to shock, severe metabolic acidosis and even death in children.
- Ask whether the child appears unwell, has an altered responsiveness, decreased urine output, pale/mottled skin, feels cold.
- Dehydration is classified in children as either mild, moderate or severe. You can determine how dehydrated a child is by looking at a series of signs:
- look at their mucous membranes, colour, level of consciousness and also the heart rate, BP and skin turgor. particularly important in children to consider capillary refill and also to weigh them. 

Investigations:
- Blood cultures are only really done if antibiotics are going to be used in a child. 
- Stool cultures should only be done if there has been recent travel, > 7 days of diarrhoea, any uncertainty about diagnosis, any septicaemia, dysentry or immunocompromise. 
- Bloods: FBC, U&Es, CRP, glucose 
- Sigmoidoscopy (rare, only if there is colitis)

Management:
- Principles of management are basically supportive. 
- Rehydrate the child
- Primary prevention: encourage fluids, milk and you can use rehydration salts
- Antibiotics are rarely needed. 
- If mildly dehydrated just substitute normal feed with oral rehydration fluid
- severe dehydration: give IV fluids (normal saline bolus dose 20ml/kg)</p>",5629,22,96,2012-12-31 15:48:39 UTC,2012-12-31 15:48:39 UTC

Menarche - Process of obtaining a period. Preceeded by - 
Adrenarche (growing hair) and Thelarche (growing long bones)</p><strong>Development of oogonia</strong><br /><br /><p>Process starts in fetus
Born with absoloute number
Decline from birth - accelerated decline from 37</p><p>Oogenesis begins in wall of Primary Yolk sac - migrate to ovary where process of maturation begins.
</p><p>Oogonia divide by MITOSIS (increase in number) - completes before birth.
</p><p>Then become Primary Oocytes by MEIOSIS (Sex cell division). Start with Diploid number (full count) of chromosomes and end up with Haploid (half).</p><p>Begin Meiosis when fetus - complete Meiosis 1 when you ovulate egg (years later.</p><p>Meiosis 2 happens on Fertilization. Extra chromosomes extruded as polar bodies.</p><strong>Hormonal Changes in Puberty</strong><br /><br /><p>Before puberty gonadotrophins (sex hormones) remain low - girls and boys similar,</p><p>Near puberty GnRH increasingly released from hypothalamus - Controls FSH and LH.</p><p>GnRH released in 90 minute intervals - pulsatile


</p><p>Increases in AMPLITUDE - not frequency.</p><p>If continuos release - dont get FSH and LH release.</p><strong>Phases of Menstrual Cycle</strong><br /><br /><p>Diagram - Stages of Hormone release</p><p>FSH - Stim Primary oocytes. Leads to development of Graffian Follicle. Matures egg for ovulation so they can be fertilised (Meiosis 2). Increases LH receptor in Ovary - allows LH to act!</p><p>LH - Acts on fecal cells of ovary - produces Androgens (which can be converted to oestrogen by Aromatization - in GRANULOSA cells)</p><p>Diagram!!! - Hormones affect Ovarian Histology and Endometrial Histology</p><p>START - Menstration (1st day of bleeding). Lasts 4 days</p><p>1st 8 days - FOLLICULAR phase. ESTROGEN LOW... therefore no feedback on LH and FSH - so they keep rising!</p><p>FSH stims certain oocytes which start to mature. 1 ends as Graffian follicle. Wastage.</p><p>LH acts on Thecal cells - aromatizing androgens to oestrogen - gradual rise in estrogen</p><p>Day 6 - 13 is PROLIFERATIVE phase - Endometrium regenerating and proliferating due to rising ESTROGEN.... BUT negative feedback (on hypothalamus nad Ant Pit) to REDUCE LH and FSH levels</p><p>BUT - so many thecal cells producing andrgens then estrogen - get MASSIVE rise in Estrogen - then causes ACUTELY positive feedback on LH and FSH...</p><p>So surge in Estrogen causes MASSIVE LH surge, and smaller FSH surge - causes OVULATION. (from 12 - 36 hours after surge.</p><p>Days 14 - 29 (had surge and ovulation) Follicle Degenerates - LUTEAL PHASE. This is FIXED phase (Follicular phase variable). </p><p>Ovarian Histology: Recruitment of primary oocytes by FSH - Dominant follicle between 9 -14 days - get lots of fluid between Granulosa cells - Antrum (Antrul follocle). This is point where dominant follicle becomes GRAAFFIAN FOLLICLE. Oocytes surrounded by 2-3 layers of granulosa cells.</p><p>If no fertilisation - becomes corpus luteum (responsible for progesterone secretion in fixed phase). Granulas cells become LEUTENIZED - larger, filled with lipid droplets and proilferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Secretion of hormones.</p><p>If NO FERTILIZATION corpus luteum produces progesterone but this degenerates - hence prog and estrogen levels decrease. ENDOMETRIAL SHEDDING.</p><p>If FERTILIZATION corpus luteum maintained by developing trophoblast. Prevents shedding!</p><p>ENDOMETRIUM > myometrium > perimetrium</p><p>Endometrium made up of BASAL layer (straight arterioles) - never changes and doesnt take part in mentruation. SUPERFICIAL layer (spiral arterioles) changes.
</p><p>PROLIFERATIVE STAGE - increasing oestrogen leads to increasing superfical layer. But glands still regular - no secretion</p><p>14 Days - INCREASED PROGESTERONE - Increases gland size, and secretion. Making endometrium habitable for trophoblast.</p><p>MENSTRUATION - End of LUTEAL PHASE. Spiral arteries contract so necrosis and shedding of superficial layer. Increased PG levels (Increase uterine contractions) - causes pain and dysmennorhoea. Thats why pain worse at beginning of period and better at end.

- Autoimmune disease - because of B cell disregulation and these are the haemolytic anaemias and the thrombocytopenia (ITP - idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura) 
- Reduced immunity - due to abnormal production (or rather lack of production) of immunoglobulins and this typically results in recurrent lower respiratory tract infections</p><p>Laboratory findings - lymphocytosis and also smear cells (abnormal lymphocytes that have been disrupted by the smearing process)
Reduced immunogolbulin sample in the blood

However this is only the dominant cell line and often there is coexistent increases in other cell lines, so increased platelet count and WCC</p><p>Diagnostically the challenge is to distinguish between primary polycythaemia or secondary polycythaemia which may be due to two patterns of disease. Which are patterns of chronic hypoxia (for example in secondary lung disease) or patterns of abnormal erythropoeitin production (for example in renal cell carcinoma or polycystic kidney disease). </p><p>So diagnostically the most important thing is to exclude any of the secondary causes of polycythaemia. Presentation is with two sets of symptoms. </p><p>Symptoms due to hyperviscosity (which occurs with or without increases in platelets). These are vascular phenomenon - headaches, visual disturbances (due to engorgement of the retinal vein), full blown vascular events (DVTs, PEs, MIs), as well as erthromelalgia, which is red painful extremeties particullarly worse in the lower limbs</p><p>The second group of clinical findings are related to increased histamine release and these are aquagenic pruritis (on contact with water) and peptic ulcerations</p><p>Investigations based on peripheral blood count and smear and bone marrow sampling </p><p>There is an increased haemoglobin and haematocrit</p><p>Possible raised platelets and white cells</p><p>Bone marrow shows increased erythroid cellularity and often reticular fibrosis</p><p>Usually a reduced serum erythropoetin</p><p>Treatment is aimed at reducing viscosity <45% with venesection or cytoreductive therapy if the platelet count is high and also to reduce thrombosis risk by giving aspirin and by maintaining platelets less than 400</p><p>Most patients with this condition live for more than 10 years however there may be transformation into leukaemia or myelofibrosis</p><strong>Essential thrombocythemia (or thrombocytosis)</strong><br /><br /><p>Hardest to diagnose because of the common phenomenon of reactive thrombocytosis in association with inflammation, infection and neoplasia as well as the other myeloproliferative disorders</p><p>The basic problem here is that the dominant cell line is megakaryotic lineage and this leads to a sustained thrombocytosis, typically greater than 600 x109 /l. The clinical presentation is often incidental but there maybe (with high platelets) a venous or arterial thrombosis or other vascular phenomenon such as headaches or visual disturbances</p><p>Investigations show a raised platelet count and the marrow shows megakaryocyte abnormalities.

Results from translocation of Abl on chromosome 9 and Bcr on chromosome 22. Resulting in formation of the Bcr-Abl protein which through activation of tyrosine kinase signalling pathways causes disregulation of various cellular processes.</p><p>Three important phases in the natural history. Patients are typically diagnosed in the chronic phase which typically lasts from a few months to up to 5 years, which can be controlled quite easily with medication. Once this progresses there is an accelerated phase with an increase in immature cells, up to 30% blast cells and then finally a transformation to an acute leukaemia called the blast phase, where there are more than 30% and this is usually refractory to treatment</p><p>Clinically presentation usually occurs in middle ages men with systemic symptoms, symptoms of bone marrow infiltration or spenomegaly which may be large enough to cause abdominal pain. In the blood there is a leucocytosis, which is philadelphia chromosone positive. Often associated basophilia and normochromic normocytic anaemia as well as a thrombocytopenia. The marrow is packed with granulocytic cells and often basophils as well.</p><p>Treatment for CML, is with Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which binds to one of the sites of the Abl-Bcr protein and holds it in an active state and prevents disregulation.</p><p>The only curative treatment is bone marrow transplant, which cures abour half</p><strong>Myelodysplastic syndromes</strong><br /><br /><p>Another group of neoplastic haematopoetic disorders caused by mutations in stem cells.

Majority of patients present with symptoms of anaemia and organomegaly is not seen. </p><p>Diagnostically the hallmark of myelodysplastic syndromes is the presence of very perculiar or dysplastic cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. However what can be a problem in diagnosing these symdromes is demonstrating this dysplasia is due to a clonal disorder rather than other dysplastic changes that can be seen in red blood cells in a variety of metabolic nutritional disorders such as vit B12 deficiency and folate deficiency</p><p>Treatment is largely supportive but doesn't really improve survival.

In more severe disease it may be more appropriate to cryoprecipitate or factor VIII</p><p>Vitamin K is required for carboxylation of factors 2, 9, 7 and 10. Includes both extrinsic factors, intrinsic factors as well as common factors we typically see raised PT and APTT. </p><p>The clinical presentation is identical between the two because factor VIII and IX form a complex required to activate factor X and subsequent common pathway coagulation.

2= quality loss
3= total loss</p><p>Inherited in autosomal dominant fashion, can cause either a problem with the number or amount of Von willebrand factor produced (type 1 disease) partial deficiency, typically presenting in adult life. Or can be due to the quality of the factor itself (type 2), or most severe form (type 3) total quantitive deficiency (most rare). Often with associated severe factor VIII defiency.

Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist. Treatment is vitamin K</p><p>Clinical presentation can be figured out by knowing vWF is important in initiating the primary haemostatic plug, the binding of platelets to the subendothelial extracellular matrix, but is also important in stabilisation of factor VIII. In most indiviudals, von willibrand disease will present the same as platelet disorders, petechiae, eccymoses, mucocutaneous bleeding. However in the most severe forms, the factor VIII pathway will be defective and a clotting pathway like presentation. </p><strong>Acquired disorders of clotting</strong><br /><br /><p>Compared to problems with platelets, disorders of coagulation present with haemarthroses and deep muscle haematomas as well as delayed bleeding after surgery or trauma, may be up to 1/2 days after insult.</p><p>>5% mild disease</p><p>Prolonged APTT (as in intrinsic pathway), normal PT</p><p>Management requires life long replacement with freeze dried factor concentrates</p><strong>Von Willebrand Disease</strong><br /><br /><p><1% severe</p><p>1-5% moderate - bleeding following mild injuries and operations</p><p>Prothrombin --> Thrombin </p><p>1) Physiology of haemostasis

3) Disorder of thrombosis</p><strong>Clotting cascade</strong><br /><br /><p>Thrombin helps Fibrinogen -->Fibrin</p><p>Formation of soluble fibrin with stabilises the plug which has been formed by the platelets.</p><p>Common pathway 
</p><p>Factors X and V either from the intrinsic or extrinsic system cause with the help of phospholipids and calcium, prothrombin (II) to be turned into thrombin (IIa). This primarily catalyses the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Pathways leading to this are extrinisic and intrinsic pathways, each of these has specific factors associated with them and this is reflected in how specific defiencies in factors affect the tests that we use to look as these two pathways.</p><p>In the intrinsic pathway, unique factors are factors VIII and factor IX. Deficiences we see in haemophilia A and B. But also includes XI and XII.
</p><strong>Physiology of haemostasis</strong><br /><br /><p>Haemostasis = normal physiological response
Thrombosis = pathological process</p><p>1) Vasoconstriction - reflex response to injury of the vessel wall</p><p>2) Platelet adhesion and activation usually because the extracellular matrix underneath the endothelium has been exposed. This results in the formation of a primary or temporary haemostatic plug which is also called a loose platelet plug</p><p>3) Stabilisation - with a fibrin rich scaffold or formation of a clot or secondary haemostatic plug. Happens due to activation of coagulation cascade, usually driven by tissue factor, stimulating a series of cascades ultimately result in thrombin formation and the conversion of the soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin</p><p>4) Self limitation - very important, prevents an explosion of clotting within the blood. This is mediated by tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) which catalyses the breakdown of plasminogen into plasmin. Plasmin is responsible for breaking down fibrinogen and fibrin into various products known as the fibrin degredation products. Also a lot of containment done by other anticoagulant factors such as anti-thrombin, protein C and protein S</p><p>Intrinsic and extrinsic pathway both lead to common pathway</p><p>In the extrinsic pathway the most important thing is tissue factor (or tissue thromboplastin) which really starts off the whole cascade when blood is exposed to the subendothelial extrcellular matrix.  The only other really unique factor here is factor VII.</p><strong>Haemostasis</strong><br /><br /><strong>Decreased platelet function</strong><br /><br /><p>FBC - Platelets, anaemia, leucopenia (may be abnormalities in bone marrow)</p><p>Coagulation screen - Three important test. Prothrombon time, usually expressed as INR - extrinsic AND common pathways (always remember common pathway included!)
APTT (Activated partial thromboplastin time) looks Exclusively at intrinsic pathway (VIII and IX). Therefore elevated in conditions affecting factors which are exclusive to this pathway such as Haemophilia factor VIII and IX.
TT (thrombin time) increased if fibrinogen level is reduced or if fibrinogen polymerisation is inhibited by fibrin degredation products, as may occur in DIC. Importantly an elevated TT can be caused</p><strong>Disorder of bleeding</strong><br /><br /><p>Disorders due to platelets (either number or function)
Disorders due to coagulation cascade</p><p>Most asymptomatic until:  <50 petechiae (specific for platelet disorders), echymoses (bruises), <20 spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeds (haematemesis, malaena, haematuria)</p><p>Acquired - Aspirin, Uraemia - quite common</p><strong>Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation</strong><br /><br /><p>Not a diagnosis but a phenomenon, typically due to an underlying disorder which cause widespread endothelial damage. Causes include disseminated gram negative sepsis, traumatic events such as amniotic fluid embolus, placental abruption. mismatched blood transfusions and end stage malignancy.</p><p>Systemic activation of clotting with intravascular deposition of fibrin and eventually depletion of platelets and coagulation factors. Therefore this is both a clotting problem causing thrombosis and a bleeding problem as well.</p><p>It therefore causes an elevated PT and an elevated APTT. An elevated TT because of the excess production of fibrin degredation products and the reduced levels due to consumption of fibrinogen. Often like in DVT these patients have an elevated D dimer level as one of the degradation products. </p><p>Treatment is supportive with heparin, platelets and other therapies. Aim to buy time to treat underlying disorder which is causing it.
</p><strong>Bleeding disorders - Thrombosis</strong><br /><br /><p>Pathological clot formation that can occur in the arterial or venous system

Basic Principles,"<strong>Signs</strong><br /><br /><p>* Clubbing: cardiac causes = subacute infective endocarditis, congenital cyanotic heart disease, atrial myxoma

* Pulse: rate, rhythm (reg/irreg - if irreg irreg - AF, or reg irreg may be certain types of heart block), character (e.g. slow rising is typical of aortic stenosis; waterhammer/collapsing pulse is typical of aortic regurgitation)

*BP - high or low, pulse pressure (narrow = assoc with slow rising pulse of AS, widened may be associated with the collapsing pulse of aortic regurg)

* JVP: elevated or not elevated? Double pulsation, that responds to pressure on abdomen. Also if you see engorged veins over the neck that is likely to correspond to a raised JVP)

* Heart sounds: S1 (closure of AV valves), S2 (closure of aortic & pulmonary valves)

* Heart murmurs - can indicate the presence of valvular pathology

* Lung sounds - heart is intimately related with the lungs. In CV exam, particularly listen to bases for bibasal crackles = fluid in lungs = pulmonary oedema</p><p></p><strong>Classification/sieve system (""vindicate"")</strong><br /><br /><p>* Vascular

* Trauma
* Endocrine/metabolic</p><strong>Investigations/Tests - system</strong><br /><br /><p>* Cultures e.g. blood cultures, sputum, urine, wound etc
* Bloods - arterial (acid-base & gas exchange) & venous (FBC, CRP, U&Es, LFTs, TFTs, ESR - note temporal arteritis is associated with a very high ESR)
* Imaging - CXR (cardiac silhouette may show cardiomegaly, lung fields may show diffuse interstitial shadowing/kerley B lines/ upper lobe diversion in heart failure presenting with pulmonary oedema). Echocardiography (info about structure & function of the heart). Cardiac MRI (can be used to image the heart in motion). Nuclear imaging perfusion studies - this can show up hibernating myocardium i.e. post-ischaemia/infarction, certain areas can become shocked but not dead, and if re-perfused with blood via angioplasty they can recover.
* Scopic/biopsy - angiography (can image vessels and provide therapy e.g. stenting)
* Functional - ECG </p><strong>Treatment in cardiology</strong><br /><br /><strong>Conservative</strong><br /><br /><p>Lifestyle management - i.e. adjust risk factors</p><strong>MEDICAL</strong><br /><br /><p>Drugs:

Lung Pathology,"<p>* 2 sets of airways: CONDUCTING (bronchi/bronchioles) & VENTILATORY/ACINUS (all distal to terminal bronchioles)

* Histology: basal cells are precursors for the 3 epithelial cell types - ciliated, goblet (mucous-secreting) & neuroendocrine.

* Respiratory failure (hypoxia - PaO2 <8) - Type 1 = V/Q mismatch [acute LVF, PE, acute asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, severe pneumonia] and type 2 (high CO2) = alveolar hypoventilation [COPD, neuromuscular disease impairing ventilation, severe acute asthma].

* Chronic hypoxia [COPD, pulmonary fibrosis] is a key cause of pulmonary hypertension due to persistent constriction of pulmonary arteries, polycythaemia (kidneys - increased EPO to try to compensate for hypoxia), RVF.

* Bronchiectasis = abnormal, permanent dilatation of airways. Self-perpetuating cycle of obstruction & infection, due to persistent destructive inflammation in walls of airways. May be localised (e.g. secondary to infection) or diffuse (e.g. CF or ciliary dyskinesias). Clinically: persistent cough with purulent sputum.

* If severe, or coexistent disease, lethargy; breathlessness; angina/intermittent claudication
* Symptoms of underlying cause may be presents</p><strong>Signs</strong><br /><br /><p>* Conjunctival pallor is the main sign, but also:
* Koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails)
* Atrophic glossitis (red, large, swollen tongue)
* Angular stomatitis (fissuring at corners of the mouth)
* high flow murmur
* Tachycardia (features of a hyperdynamic circulation - a compensatory mechanism)
* Dysphagia (rarely, because of the pharyngeal web)</p><strong>Classification by red cell size</strong><br /><br /><p>* Microcytic (IDA, thalassaemia, sideroblastic anaemia)
* Normocytic (acute blood loss, chronic disease, leukoerythroblastic)
* Macrocytic (Vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, alcoholism, hypothyroidism, liver disease)</p><strong>Classification by pathophysiology</strong><br /><br /><p>* Reduced production (haematinic deficiency - no ingredients to make red cells; bone marrow infiltration - machinery producing red cells is disturbed; chronic disease)
* Reduced lifespan (haemolysis)
* Pooling (splenomegaly)</p><strong>Reduced production of red cells</strong><br /><br /><p>* INSUFFICIENT PRODUCTION - haematinic deficiency (Fe, vit B12, folate)
* INEFFICIENT PRODUCTION - Bone marrow infiltration; myelodysplasia</p><strong>IDA</strong><br /><br /><p>* Main store of iron in the body is in the red cells themselves. There are additional stores in the liver, ferritin and haemosiderin
* Causes of IDA:
1) Reduced intake (malnutrition)
2) Increased demand (pregnancy, growth spurts in childhood)
3) Malabsorption (coeliac disease, post-gastrectomy. Key site of absorption is duodenum)
4) Blood loss -chronic
* FBC & haematinics
1) Hb LOW
2) MCV LOW
3) Ferritin LOW (but is an acute phase reactant so is pushed up by inflammation)
4) Serum iron LOW/TIBC [total iron binding capacity] HIGH</p><p>NOTE anaemia in itself is not a diagnosis; requires investigation until CAUSE is found (e.g. bleeding malignancy). Treatment - replace iron </p><strong>Megaloblastic anaemias</strong><br /><br /><p>NB: macrocytosis (MCV >96) is not the same as megaloblastic anaemia; megaloblast is a type of macrocyte (a cell in which nuclear development is delayed) & megaloblastic anaemia may be caused by B12 or folate deficiency, because these vitamins are needed for DNA synthesis. However you can also get non-megaloblastic macrocytosis, caused by alcohol, reticulocytosis, liver disease etc.</p><p>* Vit B12 & folate are needed for cell maturation
* Absence leads to reduced cell output + abnormal cells
* All cell lines are affected:
* Red cells - macrocytosis
* Neutrophils - hypersegmented (+ leucopaenia)

* Reduced intake (rare, but can get in vegan diet)
* Impaired absorption (stomach - impaired production of IF; ileum - Crohn's disease)</p><strong>PERNICIOUS ANAEMIA</strong><br /><br /><p>* Autoimmune attack on parietal cells -- atrophic gastritis & LACK OF INTRINSIC FACTOR)
* Reduced serum B12
* Autoantibodies may be seen:
* 90% of patients have anti-parietal cell antibodies
* 50% have anti-IF antibodies
* Associations: other autoimmune disease; gastric adenocarcinoma</p><strong>Clinical features of B12 deficiency</strong><br /><br /><p>* Common features of anaemia, but also, specific to B12:
* Peripheral neuropathy, leading to subacute combined degeneration (involvement of posterior & lateral columns of the cord - loss of proprioception, weakness, can involve profound ataxia)</p><strong>Treatment of B12 deficiency</strong><br /><br /><p>* Hydroxycobalamin IM injections
* Should always be given with folate; if you start someone on folate without giving B12, and they have an underlying deficiency of B12, you can precipitate some of the neurological features)</p><strong>FOLATE DEFICIENCY</strong><br /><br /><p>* Dietary factors (spinach, broccoli, offal)
* Malabsorption
* Increased demand e.g. pregnancy, myeloproliferation, haemolysis

- extremes of age
- chronic illness (kidney or liver disease)
- infections (uti, TORCH)
- drugs (e.g.warfarin or phenytoin causes vit K deficiency which results in a bleeding abnormality)
- poor past obstetric history - multiple miscarriages
- obstetric complications - previous group B strep infection

Fetal
- multiple pregnancy
- TTTS - twins, one which is the donor and one which is the reciepient where one twin is giving blood to the other. recipient - oedematous, large, polycythemic. donor- small, thin and anaemic
- congenital malformations - cleft palate, gastrochesia (gut outside abdomen)
- chromosomal abnormalities
- Hydrops fetalis - excess body water causing oedema caused by:- Noonan's syndrome, anaemia
-IUGR </p><strong>Prenatal screening and diagnosis</strong><br /><br /><p>- blood group and antibodies for rheuses - to prevent rhesus incompatibily disease = this happens if a mother is Rh -ve and fetus is Rh +ve = mother has antibodies against Rh +ve which can cross over the placenta and destory babys blood cells causing severe jaundice and anaemia. Therefore a Rh -ve mother is given Anti-D at 28 and 34 weeks

- Hep B, C, rubella, syphillis and HIV - tested
- serum AFP - high in neural tube defects (reduced risk with folic acid)
- Triple Test for Trisomy 21 ( AFP, B-HCG and Estriol)
- Gestational diabetes OGT given at 28 weeks 

- Screening test for Down Syndrome
- 10-14 weeks  = nuchal translucency 
- Triple Test - low AFP
                - low oestriol
                - high B-HCG
- Quadruple test - inhibin which is high in down syndrome

If the risk is greater then 1/250 then the lady is offered amniocentesis. 

High AFP
- neural tube defects
- cardiac abnormality
- gastrochesis

Adaptations at Birth,"<strong>fetal life</strong><br /><br /><p>- lungs filled with amniotic fluid
- high pulmonary vascular resistance
- low resistance in placenta = high flow of blood through the placenta
- patent ductus arteriosus so only a small amount of blood flows into the lungs

Blood flow in the umbilical cord
umbilical vein = carries oxygenated blood
umbilical artery = carries deoxygenated blood

Blood Flow
- due to high pulmonary vascular resistance blood from the right side bypasses the lungs via the ductus arteriosus which connects the right ventricle to the descending aorta
- foramen ovale connects the L and R atria
- ductus venosus shunts the umbilical vein blood flow to the IVC bypassing the liver</p><strong>birth</strong><br /><br /><p>- lung liquid production reduced (amniotic fluid in the lungs)
- infants chest squeezed, lung liquid drained
- increased catacholamine levels stimulate breathing
- first gasp - within 6 secs
- breathing stimulated absorption of remaining lung fluid (amniotic fluid)

Umbilical cord is clamped
- venous return to the RA from the placenta reduced
- rise in the LA pressure from increased pulmonary venous return
- low RA pressure closes the foramen ovale
- ductus venosus closes due to reduced umbilical venous return

Lung Expansion
- causes rise in oxygen levels
- lung aeration - decreased pulmonary vascular resistance
- pulmonary blood flow increases
- flow of oxygenated blood closes the ductus arteriosus (PDA if doesnt happen)

Factors that increase pulmonary vascular resistance and interefere with adaptation
- birth hypoxia
- acidosis
- heart problem

IUGR,"<strong>placenta</strong><br /><br /><p>-metabollically active organ
- regulated two way transport between the mother and fetus

Development - placentation
- implantation of the blastocyst into the decidua (part of the uterus)
- blastocyst becomes covered in outer layer- syncytiotrophoblast and inner- cytotrophoblast
- trophoblast differentiaties into villious and extravillious trophoblast
- from 18 days after conception placental blood vessels form via vasculogenisis 

Functions
- endocrine
- exchange
- protective

Endocrine
- production of hCG sustains production of progesterone and oestrogen by the corpus luteum prior implantation
- produce progesterone and oestrogen
- human placental lactogen - preps breasts for lactation

Exchange
- fetal lungs

Protective
- stops maternal and fetal blood coming into direct contact 
- trophoblastic cells form a barrier between mother and fetus</p><strong>assesment of fetal growth</strong><br /><br /><p>Ultrasound of fetal growth
- head circumference
- fetal biparietal diameter
- abdominal circumference
- head- abdominal ratio= MOST IMPORTANT (as you want head and abdo to be growing at the same rate otherwise can be a sign of growth retardation)

Amniotic fluid volume
- too much or too little

Fetal umbilical artery Doppler
- measures flow- absent or reversed = poor placental function
- reveresed is worse then absent flow
- associated with increased likelihood of IUGR and of perinatal mortality</p><strong>oligohydramnios</strong><br /><br /><p>TOO LITTLE amniotic fluid
- less than the 5th centile for gestation
-AFI- amniotic fluid index is a USS estimation of amniotic fluid

Suspected oligiohydraminos clinically
- history of clear fluid leaking from the vagina
- fetal poles felt very obviously

Causes
- usually renal or urinary tract abdnormality in the fetus as the aminotic fluid is made up most of fetal urine
- renal agenesis (Potter's syndrome = no kidneys in the fetus and is incompatible with life)
- multicystic kidneys
- urinary tract abnormalities
- NSAIDS
- IUGR and placental insufficency
- premature rupture of membranes</p><strong>polyhydramnios</strong><br /><br /><p>EXCESS amniotic fluid
- AFI> 95th centile

Suspected
- on examination the abdomen feels distended
- abdominal size is out of proportion for dates- symphysial- fundal height

Causes
- diabetes (maternal)
- multiple gestation- twin to twin transfusion
- idiopathic
- oesphageal atresia stopping the fetus from swallowing the amniotic fluid</p><strong>IUGR</strong><br /><br /><p>Definition
- when a baby has failed to reach its growth potential or where there has been a decline in growth velocity

Symmertrical or Asymmetrical

Symmetrical
- head and weight both reduced
- early pregnancy problem
- most severe

Causes
- chromosomal abnormality (trisomy 13(Patau's), 18(Edwards) and 21(downs))
- congenital malformation
- intrauterine infection - TORCH infections

Asymmetrical
- the weight is affected greater then the head
- head keeps growing but the abdo doesnt (head sparing)

Causes
- third trimester restrictions
- Maternal - poor nutrition, substance misuse, chronic disease
- Placental insufficency- preeclampsia, diabetes, sickle cell

Uteroplacental insufficency (poor placenta)
- failure of the extravillious trophoblastic infection
- reduced uterine artery blood flow
- clinical sign - abnormal doppler

Infants are at risk of
- hypothermia- due to reduced subcutaneous fat
- hypoglycaemia- reduced glycogen stores
- polycythaemia- due to chronic hypoxia

Investigations
- confirm gestation
-karyotype if any dysmorphic features or chromosomal abnormalities
- TORCH screening
- monitor temperature and blood glucose
- venous blood test to test for polycythemia</p><strong>small for gestational age</strong><br /><br /><p>- means that the baby is below the 10th centile</p><strong>Fetal macrosomia</strong><br /><br /><p>- most common cause is diabetes

Paediatric Cardiology,"<strong>antenatal circulation</strong><br /><br /><p>Ductus venosus
- connects the umbilical vein to the IVC
- blood flow regulated by the sphincter
- oxygenated blood from mum

- blood is then diverted from the ductus venosus directly to the aorta

Ductus Arterosus
- protects against circulatory overload
- connect to the aorta and shunts the blood from the ductus venosus into the aorta
- allows the right ventricle to strengthen
- oxygenated blood
- low pulmonary blood flow and high pulmonary vascular resistance

Foramen Ovale
- bypasses blood away from the right ventricle
- allows for blood to shunts from right atria to the right ventricle
- high rich oxygenated blood from the mum

At Birth
- ductus arterosus/venosus and foramen ovale and umbilical vessels no longer needed
- ducutus venosus sphincter constricts, diverting blood to the liver
- when baby is born it can start to breath and the lungs start working
- occlusion of placental circulation causes an immediate drop in BP in the IVC and right atrium

Umbilical Vein (intra abdominal part) =  Ligamentum teres
Ductus Venosus = Ligamentum Venosum
Umbilical Arteries and abdominal ligaments = medial umbilical ligaments and superior vesicular artery (supplies the bladder)
Ductus Arteriosum = Ligamentum arteriosum
</p><strong>NOn cyanotic defects</strong><br /><br /><p>Atrial Septal Defect
- patent foramen ovale
- septum irregularity- primum or secundum

- normally baby born and pressure changed cause the foramen to shut off
- can be seen in adults- cough or hypertensive epidsodes are often the pc
- size of the defect can results in L-R shunting or RVH (due to right sided overload)
- shift is from the high pressure to the low pressure side

Eisenmenger's Syndrome
- normally blood will shift from high pressure to low pressure so from left to right, but eventually if this continues the pressure changes in the heart, and the higher pressured side will become the right side, this then results in a right to left shift of blood and therefore causes a very sick child and results in a cynotic defect

Diagnosis
- Auscultation - fixed splitting of S2
- ECG - prolongation of the PR interval ( due to problems with the atria)
          - axis deviation (due to pressure shift)
-ECHO
-CXR - right ventricular hypertrophy (due to pressure shift)
        - cardiomegaly
        - enlarged pulmonary markings

Management
- prone to infective endocarditis
- usually does not affect life
- if child very ill then surgical closure

Ventricular Septal Defect
- most common congenital heart disease
- associated with Downs

Signs
- breathlessness
-poor feeding
- failure to thrive

- left has higher pressure so shunting from left to right
- acynotic condition

Diagnosis
Auscultation- pansystolic murmur
                  - loud second heart sound
ECG- pulmonary hyptertension
       - axis deviation
ECHO
CXR - RVH

Management
Conservative
Medical- digoxin, diuretics
Surgical - caution as near the AVN

Atrio-ventricular septal defects
- mostly seen with downs
-management very similar to VSD

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
- aortic blood shunted into the pulmonary artery

associated with
- maternal rubella infection via vertical transmission during pregnancy
- premature infants usually have PDA due to hypoxia and immaturity (not enough time for the duct to close off)

- machinery type murmur***</p><p>Coarctation of the Aorta
- kinking of the aortic arch
- symptoms not seen until the PDA closes
- may also have a VSD

Disrupted flow in the arch is going to cause
- loud noises = murmur
- poor descending flow = bp changes in the lower legs
- heart failure due to back pressure

Auscultation- ejection systolic murmur (best heard at shoulder blades)
ECG- severe R wave progression
       - ventricular hypertrophy R then L

Treatment
- balloon to dialate the kinking

Interrupted Aortic Arch
- no connection between the arch
- so there is normally a VSD
- Associated with Di George's
                                       - No thymus
                                       - Hypocalcaemia

- Tricuspid Atresia

Tetralogy
- cynotic heart condition
- to do with the septal condition

- VSD
- obstruction of blood flow - pulmonary stenosis(from the right ventricle to the lungs)
- Aorta (lies directly over the VSD)
- Right Ventricular Hypertrophy

- mixing of blood due to septal defect
- stenosis results in poor blood flow to lungs and body
- inadequate of pumping of blood to PA
- clubbing

Diagnosis
- auscultation
- ECG
- ECHO
-CXR - BOOT SHAPED HEART**** = ""coeur-en-sabot""
        - RVH

- poor prognosis

Transposition
- switching of the great arteries
- pulmonary
- aortic

2 main variants
-Levo (left)
-Dextro (right)

Levo
- left and right ventricle is swapped
- arteries are the same

Dextro
- arteries themselves switch completely
- atrial septal defect ( compensation by the body)
- oxygenated blood is going to the lungs and deoxygenated to the body
- resulting in cynosis

Surgical intervention

Tricuspid Atresia
- no tricuspid valve
- atrial septal defect (compensation)

- multisystem disorder- chronic respiratory tract infection and pancreatic enzyme insuffciency
- carrier rate- 1/25
life expectancy- 30-40 years

-mutation to the CFTR gene ( cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)
- CFTR is a glycoprotein found in epithelial cells found in airways, ducts of pancreas, biliary system, vas deferens and sweat glands
- function- chloride channel 
</p><strong>pathogenisis</strong><br /><br /><p>- loss of function of CFTR gene
- decreased secretion of chloride
- increased reabsorption of sodium + water across epithelial cells

Failure to Thrive,"<strong>DEFINITION</strong><br /><br /><p>decelleration of a childs growth in
-weight- most senstive measure, this will be the first measure to change
-height
-head circumference- will usually be spared
- falling trajecotry on their growth charts</p><strong>growth charts</strong><br /><br /><p>- childs age on the x-axis
- weight/height etc- on the y-axis</p><strong>approach to patient</strong><br /><br /><p>- negative connotations in the community

Certain conditions that look like failure to thrive
- genetic short stature- consistantly follow a lower percentile
- extreme prematurity
- constitutional delay- take longer to grow realtive to thier peers
- catch-down growth- this is when a bigger baby at birth will go down in centiles before going back up and stablizing</p><strong>causes</strong><br /><br /><p>1. Increased use of calories
2. Inefficient use of calories
3. Decreased intake of calories

e.g. baby with gastroentritis will begin with vomiting which will be inefficient use of calories, then will become pyrexic so have increased usage then become anorexic which will decrease intake of calories

1. increased caloric use
- chronic infections- febrile illness, tb, hiv
- chronic illness
  - respiratory = CF/ severe asthma
  - endocrine- typle 1 DM
  - renal- tubular acidosis/ renal failure
Congenital disorder
- cardiac defects- shunts

The Ventricular System,"<strong>Positioning</strong><br /><br /><p>- choriod plexus one in each ventricle for the manufacture and production of CSF
- 3rd ventricle midline structure
- large lateral ventricles which narrow down into the aqueduct and then becomes the 4th ventricle. 
- trianglar shaped 4th ventricle sits anterior of the cerebellum</p><p>- the only way in and out of the ventricular system is through the 4th ventricle
- this is how when you have had a SAH the blood gets into the ventricular plexus

Median Aperture- communicates with the system just lying below and posterior to the brain stem, this is how the csf communicates with the sub-arachnoid space

4th ventricle- cerebellum behind and the pons in front

Lateral Aperture- communication laterally with the sub arachnoid space

Central canal with CSF in it that communcated down into spinal cord

- the CSF will circulate through the sub arachnoid space until its reabsorbed by the arachnoid granulations</p><strong>hydrocephalus</strong><br /><br /><p>Why hydrocephalus with SAH?

- CSF produced in the choroid plexus and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations- little protrusions of arachnoid matter that protude forward and CSF gets in to venous circulation and recirculated into the blood

- concept is the blood in the sub arachnoid space blocks the arachnoid granulations.  </p>",5332,12,179,2012-12-31 15:47:27 UTC,2012-12-31 15:47:27 UTC

Monocular Blindness
- temporal artritis
- diabetes
- syphillis
- demylination
- nerve compression
-occlusion of rentinal artery

Bitemporal Hemianopia
- the nasal sides of the retina are affected and they converge at the optic chiasm
- pituitary adenoma

Homonymous heminopia
- nasal field of one field and the temporal field of the other
- tumour/vascular accident
- temporal retina stays on the same side whereas the nasal retina crosses over at the optic chaism so the lesion will have to be post chiasmal in order to cause this loss in vision
- tumour or vascular accident

Homonomoyous + sparing
- usually occurs posterior stroke
- things at the back split into temporal and parietal lobe which allows for quadraniopia's to occur

*** LOOK AT VISUAL FIELD DIAGRAM***</p><strong>III, IV, VI</strong><br /><br /><p>Light Reflect Pathway
- PERLA- pupils equal respond to light and accomidation
when you sign a light in someones eye the optic nerve II, carries the impulse to the brain and the oculomotor nerve, III, responds with constriction of the pupil via the efferent pathway

- if you have an unreactive R and a reactive constriciting L eye then you can tell that the oculomotor nerve on the R side isnt working but the optic is as the L eye responded.

Pupillary Dilatation
- Myotonic Pupil- can be caused by Holmes Adie syndrome
- III nerve palsy
- Antimuscarinic (e.g. atropine post MI or intentionally at an opthamologist)

Pupillary Constriction (parasympathetic)
- Argyll Robertson Pupil (prostitute)- cause by syphilis, accomidates but doesnt react like a prostitute
- Horner's syndrome- chracteristic clinical signs- ptosis, meiosis and ipsilateral anhydrosis

Postpartum Haemorrhage,"<strong>definition</strong><br /><br /><p>Primary PPH- more than 500ml of blood loss in the first 24hours

Secondary PPH- abnormal bleeding from 24hrs after delivery to 12 wks post delivery </p><strong>causes</strong><br /><br /><p>TONE
- the tone of the uterus
- after delivery you get an increase of the hormone oxytocin, which causes uterine contraction which compresses myometrial blood vessels for delivery of the placenta
- if this doesnt occur  the uterus will continur to bleed the result is uterine atony
RF- multiple gestation 

TISSUE
- placental retention is the key problem here
- usually the placenta should deliver within 30min, if this does not happen then the result is alteration of the structure of the uterus which stops it contracting properly
- may be due to placenta accreta, percreta and increta= overinvasion of the placenta and therefore is not able to come away from the uterus very easily

TRAUMA
- cervical, vaginal lacerations, episiotomy - often done in instrumental deliveries
- can cause hidden haematomas
- cause shock disproportionate to visualised blood loss

THROMBIN
- clotting abnormalities not previously known, therefore very preventable
-e.g. Von Willerbands disease</p><strong>prevention of pph</strong><br /><br /><p>- check for Hb/clotting disorders at antenatal clinic
- if previous c-section then ultrasound or MRI for placental lie- this is because if there is a previous c-section the placenta can attach onto the scarred area resulting in placenta previa
- active management of the 3rd stage of labour with syntocinon just after delivery of the ant. shoulder- proven to increase tone of uterus
- can consider- syntometrien (ergometriene and syntocinon) and misoprostol
- early cord clamping and cutting
- check obs and vagina for bleeding</p><strong>RISK FACTORS PPH</strong><br /><br /><p>Antepartum

Eclampsia,"<strong>definition</strong><br /><br /><p>- convulsions superimposed on pre-eclampsia

Pre-eclampsia- characterized by hypertension and protienuria, complications can occur in any system in the body

- any convulsion during pregnancy should be treated as eclampsia

- FITS = eclampsia ( can occur up to 2 days after delivery)</p><strong>Pre eclampsia</strong><br /><br /><p>Disease of pregnancy that comes from the placenta- when the placenta is delivered the risk dissapears but can remain for 2 days

RF

- IUGR- small, stop passing urine, abnormalities in doppler of cord or brain
- fetal bradycardia- shown on cardiotrophograph
- respiratory distress syndrome- due to pre-maturity, mum can be given steriods to prevent this

Normal Labour,"<strong>Definition</strong><br /><br /><p>- presence of uterine contractions with dialation and effacement of the cervix
- during pregnancy the uterus is soft under the influence of progesterone and the cervix is firm and closed
-at the end of pregnancy the uterus becomes more active at first with braxton-hicks contractions and cervix becomes soft and opens to allow baby to deliver</p><strong>stages of labour</strong><br /><br /><p>1. initiation to labour to full dialation
2. full dialation of cervix to delivery of fetus
3. delivery of fetus to delivery of the placenta</p><strong>Stage 1</strong><br /><br /><p>Initiation to full dialation and effacement

1. Cervix closed
2. Ripening of latent phase cervix becomes soft and starts to open
3. ACCELCERATIVE PHASE- increasingly opens 2-3cm- 8/9cm
4.TRANSITION (decellerative)- most painful, just before full dilation

Effacement
- shortening of cervical canal from 3cm to circular orifice
- ""show"" - mucus brown coloured discharge with he consistency of egg white

Dilatation
- depends on progressive upper uterine shortening and lower uterine distension
- full dialation= 10cm
- rate varies with parity </p><strong>stage 2</strong><br /><br /><p>1. PASSIVE- passive decent of the head to the pelvic floor- engagement
2. ACTIVE- head on pelvic floor to delivery. mother actively pushing

Movements of head during delivery- normal fetus will present to the vertix with a flexed head, goes in sidewayd into the pelvis then rotates so that its nose is facing the anus (floor of pelvis). As it goes through the birth canal and out through the vulva the head will extend so what is seen is the forehead followed by the face

Anatomy of the Pelvic
Inlet- 11cm AP - wider transversley which is why the baby comes down horizontally
Outlet- 13cm AP- narrower transversley which is why the baby must rotate to be deliverd
-ischial spines are used as landmarks to assess descent of head
- engagement is when the widest part of the head has passed the inlet of the pelvic brim- at 2.5/5 

-head changes shape as it moulds- changes from a football shape to a rubgy ball shape, 

Presentation
- part of the fetal body that is foremost within or close to the birth canal
- cephalic, breech, if oblique = cord or shoulder (dystocia)

Presenting part
- lowest part of the fetus palpable on vaginal examination
- cephalic, vertex, brow, face

Fetal Head- position
- rotation of the head in relation to the pelvis
- OCCIPITO- TRANSVERSE, OA, OP
- SACRO-ANTERIOR (breech), SP,ST</p><strong>STAGE 3</strong><br /><br /><p>- normally 30 mins
- normal blood loss 100-300ml

Retained Placenta
- if not delivered after an hour

Post- Partum Haemmorhage
- loss of more than 500ml
- relies on the smooth muscle contraction of the uterus and retracting to compress the blood vessels to stop bleeding
- most common cause of post partum hammorhage is uterine atony= uterus relaxing and not contracting and retained products</p><strong>management of normal labour</strong><br /><br /><p>Active Management in the 3rd stage

1. oxytocin administration - IM

2. controlled traction- cord pulled while other hand is placed upon symphasis pubis to prevent the placenta from inverting

Antenatal Care,"<strong>High risk pregnancy: maternal</strong><br /><br /><p>- extremes of age- older ( 35<) or young
- chronic disease- liver or kidney disease
- infections-rubella, UTI, hepatitis, HIV
-drugs- pheytoin- disrupts vit.K metabolism putting fetus at risk of bleeding after birth, warfarin, and alcohol (FAS)
- poor past obstretric history- multiple miscarriages
- obstretric complications- previous group B strep infection, pre-eclampsia in previous pregnancy</p><strong>high risk pregnancy: fetal</strong><br /><br /><p>- multiple pregnancy
-IVF
- twin to twin transfusion syndrome- you have a donor (thin, anemic) and recipient ( becomes swollen, large and polycythemic)- twins are identical and monochromic
-congenital malformations- cleft palate, gastrochesia- where the gut is outside the abdomen
- chromosomal abnormalities- known down syndrome, edwards syndrome (trisomy 18)
-IUGR
-Hydrops fetalis- excess body water causing oedema of the fetus caused by anaemia, cardiac disease and Noonan syndrome (type of dwarfism)</p><strong>prenatal screening and diagnosis</strong><br /><br /><p>- blood group and antibodies for Rh
If Rh negative the mother is given Anti-D during pregnancy to prevent rh-incompatibility disease. This happens if the mother is Rh negative and the fetus is Rh positive, mother has antibodies against Rh+ these cross the placenta into the fetus and can destroy fetal blood cells which results in jaundice and anaemia. So to prevent this Anti -D is given at 28 and 34 weeks as there is no way of knowing the the fetus is positive or negative

- Hepatitis B ( fetus can be given an injection after birth to prevent transmission after birth) & C, rubella (if not immune MMR is given after birth), syphillis, HIV (identify babies that need extra treatment after birth, reduce vertical transmission by giving ARVs  after birth, delivering by c-section and restricting breast feeding

- serum AFP- high in neural-tube defects e.g. spina bifida, this can be reduced by folic acid
- triple test:- AFP, B-HCG, Estriol
-Hb studies:- thalassemia and sickle cell in ethnic groups
- Gestational diabetes- at 28 weeks OGTT</p><strong>SCREENING TEST FOR DOWN SYNDROME</strong><br /><br /><p>- gives you a risk/probability whether your baby will have downs

Nuchal Tranlucency
-10-14weeks, skin at back of neck (nuchal fold) thicker then usual then baby more at risk

Triple Test- in a baby with down syndrome this is what is expected
- AFP - low
-Estriol- low
- B-HCG- rasied

- if these test come back positive the risk is calculated and the lady is then offered amniocentisis for definitive diagnostics.</p><strong>AFP</strong><br /><br /><p>- AFP can be raised if baby is wrong for dates, multiple pregnancy and bleeding in early pregnancy 

High AFP
- neural tube defects
- cardiac abnormalities
- gastrochesis

Low AFP
- down syndrome</p><strong>Antenatal diagnostic test</strong><br /><br /><p>- 20 week abnormality scan- gastrochesia and exomphalos
- Chorionic Villus Sampling after 10 weeks- genetic diagnosis
- cleft palate or skeltal abnormalities
- amniocentisis- 14-16 wks= karotype= risk of 1% miscarriage, but is offered to every women over 35. 
- fetal blood sampling</p><strong>Management of Preterm baby</strong><br /><br /><p>Respiratory Distress Syndrome
- lungs are not adequately developed to allow for sufficient gas exchange for the baby
- baby does not have enough surfactant in the lungs
- surfactant can be increased by giving the mother steriods

- delay premature labor- TOCOLYTICS e.g. salbutamol indicated in mothers that are going into labor between 25-34 weeks delays labor by 24-48 hours (long enough time to give steroids) </p><strong>maternal conditions affecting pregnancy and fetus</strong><br /><br /><p>Diabetes- type 1
- polyhydraminious
- increased miscarriage
- pre-eclampsia
- increased congenital abnormalities

Gestational Diabetes only occurs during pregnancy 
- not associated with increased congential abnormalities
- increased risk of IUGR (increased in diabetics that have microvasucular complications) 
- macrosomia ( all diabetics)
Neonates Risk
- hypoglycaemia - diabetics have a high sugar level to compensate the fetus produces more insulin. At birth the maternal supply of high glucose is gone but the fetus is still producing the same amount of insulin so therefore increased risk of hypoglycaemia
- RDS syndrome
- polycythemia
- hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 

Hyperthyroidism
- circulating high levels of TSH
-TSH crosses placenta and activates fetal thyroid
- baby gets symptoms of hyperthyroid= diahorrea, tachycardia, gitters</p>",5332,20,127,2012-12-31 15:47:26 UTC,2012-12-31 15:47:26 UTC
Ectopic Pregnancy,"<strong>definition and epidemiology</strong><br /><br /><p>- implantation of a pregnancy in a site in any other cavity other than the endometrial cavity
- common and rising partly due to increase in detection rate and the increase prevalence of pelvic infections
- leading cause of maternal death in the first trimester
</p><strong>Classification</strong><br /><br /><p>A. Tubal

B. Other
- cervical, ovarian, abdominal</p><strong>pathogenisis</strong><br /><br /><p>1. Tubal Factors
- any damage to the fallopian tubes e.g. due to surgery or infection increases the risk of ectopic. 10 times more common in women with a history of infection e.g. chlamydia

2. Chromosomal factors
- chromosomal abnormalities in a developing fetus is predisposed to ectopic implantation

3. Hormonal Factors
- progesterone is known to slow down smooth muscle contractility therefore thought to predispose to ectopic pregnancy</p><strong>clinical presentation</strong><br /><br /><p>mild pain --> massive haemodynamic comprimise and collapse

Menstrual Cycle,"<strong>OOGONIA AND SEXUAL MATURITY</strong><br /><br /><p>Puberty
- girl ages 11-15
-menarche-process of obtaining a period
-adrenarche- growing hair in axillary and pubic areas
-tenarche- growing of long bones

Development of oogonia
- process starts in the foetus
- at ages 34 the number of oogonia decline at an accelerated pace

Oogenesis
- oogonia start in the wall of the primary yolk sac
-migrate to the ovaries where the process of replication via mitosis begins
- all replicated the amount of oogonia before birth
- become primary oocytes- maintain the same number of sex chromosomes- via meiosis
-go from diploid to haploid of chromosomes to 23
- being meiosis as a foetus and complete meiosis 1 when you ovulate the egg
- meiosis II only occurs when fertilization occurs
-extra chromosomes become polar bodies

Hormonal changes in puberty
-before puberty the levels of gondatrophins remain low
-near puberty GnRH increasingly released from the hypothalamus
- GnRH controls the release of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary
- released in pulses in 90 minute intervals- this increases in amplitude NOT frequency
- continous release of GnRH will not allow for the release of FSH and LH must be PULSATILE
-causes release of FSH and LH from anterior pituitary</p><strong>phases of the menstraul cycle</strong><br /><br /><p>hypothalamus- GnRh -->> anterior  pituitary- LH and FSH release -->> Ovaries - development of oocytes and oestrogen secretion 

Follicle Stimulating Hormone 
-stimulates primary oocytes- leading to development of graffian follicule, basically matures the egg so they can be fertilized
-increases LH receptors

Lutenizing Hormone
-acts on thecal cells of the ovaries
-produces androgens
-androgens can be converted to oestrogens in the granulomar cells by aromatization
</p><p>Day 1:- menstruation usually lasts about 4 days

Day 1- Day 8- follicular stage
-oestrogen levels are low-negatively feedback
-increase in LH and FSH as feedback from GnRH
-FSH stimulates growth of primary oocytes- causing them to mature
-LH starts increasing the levels of oestrogen from the thecal cell androgen

Day 6-14- proliferative phase
-endometrium is proliferating and growing due to increase in oestrogen

-increase of oestrogen negatively feeds back on the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary resulting in a decrease in LH and FSH levels

-eventually you get such a rise in oestrogen because of thecal cell action, which causes a oestrogen surge which causes a LH surge and FSH

-LH surge due to positive feedback from oestrodiol results in ovulation

Day 14-29- luteal phase
-no fertilization
- follicle degenerates and becomes the corpus luteum
-corpus luteum= granulosar cells become leutanized- cell become larger in size and cytoplasm becomes filled with lipid droplets
- this stage is always fixed</p><strong>End of menstrual cycle</strong><br /><br /><p>-endometrial shedding occurs
-if fertilization does occur then you get hormorne release from the trophoblast</p><strong>Endometrium</strong><br /><br /><p>2 layers
-basal layer= with straight arterioles
-superficial layer= spiral layers - changes during menstruation

Changes during the menstrual cycle

proliferative stage
- increased growth of superficial layer due to oestrogen levels increasing
-glands in a very regular pattern in the endometrium
-no secretion

day 14
- increase in progesterone (makes endometrium habitable for the trophoblast)
-results in an increase secretion from glands in endometrium

during menstruation
- end of luteal phase
-spiral arteries contract
-necrosis and shedding of superficial layer
- prostaglandin levels increase- causing uterine contraction (period pains- usually worst at beginning and get better over the course of the shedding)

</p><strong>Pathology</strong><br /><br /><p>-damage to the ovary
-disruption of hormonal levels

- inhibition of sodium re-absorption at the early DCT
- act quickly

Hypertension
- bendroflurothiazide- 2.5mg
- indapamide- thiazide like diuretics= less aggravation of electrolytes and diabetes- should not usually be prescribed in pts with diabetes

Removal of salt and water in mild HF

Metalazone- very powerful in combination with loop diuretic (even in renal failure) used in pts that are in resistant oedema an have a very profound diuresis so must monitor fluid balance very closely

S/E

-hypokalaemia can increased digoxin toxicity</p><strong>LOOP DIURETICS</strong><br /><br /><p>Pharmacology
-the most powerful of all of the diuretics
-act on the thick segment of the desceding loop of henle
- act on the Na/K/Cl symporter to decrease reabsorption of sodium causing it be increasingly excreted with water following
- also cause venodialation and reduce preload
-act within an hr if given orally
-lasts for 6hrs
-furosemide and bunetamide (40 times as potent) 

Indications
-mild to severe HF- the symptoms- does not prolong life expectancy but treats the oedema
-LVF with pulmonary oedema- give IV furosemide causing a net loss of fluid an venous dilation and therefore a reduction of preload thus reducing the back flow and pressure into the lungs 
-hypercalcaemia 

Contraindications
-renal failure and anuria

Side effects
- electrolyte abberation- hyponaturaemia
- if given very quickly can cause ototoxic and can potentiate the ototoxic effect of other drugs such as gentamycin especially in renal failure

1. acute coronary prevention e.g. aspirin use either alone or with copidegrel in ACS 

2. primary prevention- agent to prevent delvelopment of a disease

3.secondary prevention- agent given to improve prognosis of said disease e.g. post ACS or in AF- warfarin is usually used but an alternative for pts at risk of falls aspirin is a suitable replacement. </p><strong>ASPIRIN</strong><br /><br /><p>- very common
-smaller 75mg dose used in this purpose but can be used as an analgesic in 300mg forms

mechanism
- irreversible inhibitor of COX particularly 1 and 2. therefore reducing synthesis of prostaglands which are very imp for stimulating and maintaining a pro-aggretatory state
-preferential inhibition of platelets

Primary and Secondary prevention
- MI, ischemic stroke, TIA
- often the underlying disease that results in these events is usually a rupture of a athersclerotic plaque which is very pro aggregatory and will stimulate the formation of a clot. so by giving a anti-platelet agent you reduce this risk significantly

Adverse Reactions
- gi bleed- cannot give aspirin to a pt that has a hx of gastric problems
- bronchospasm- due to the effect on leukotrienes
-gout precipitation- usually in the 300mg form

*** children under the age of 16 shouldn't be given aspirin because of risk of REYE'S syndrome- resulting the encephalitis and acute liver failure.**** (therefore give paracetamol)

-idiosyncratic reaction with methotrexate</p><strong>CLOPIDOGREL</strong><br /><br /><p>-thenopyradine

Mechanism
- irreversibly blocks the P2Y12 receptor on the platelet surface therefore reducing aggregation
Dose
-requires a loading dose usually a 300mg in ACS
-normal dose is 75mg

ACS
- given together with aspirin 300mg each

Adverse Profile
-neutropenia

phase 2- plateau - at this point there is calcium that moves into the cell and potassium that leaves the cell. 

phase 3- re-polarization, movement of potassium moving into the cell. 

phase 4- varies according to cell type, e.g. a cardiac cell has a flat stage 4 and therefore needs stimulation to push them back into action, whereas the purkinje fibers without any stimulation there is an automatic depolarization on their own

* drugs relate very much to these ions and how they move</p><strong>conduction system</strong><br /><br /><p>SAN-impulse generator, AV node, left and right bundle of his which is very quick, then down to the purkinje fibers

SAN- most leaky type of cells, they have a greater background conductance to sodium, and therefore go up to threshold very quickly causing depolarization- thus governing the pace maker ---- sinus rhythm is governed by the SAN</p><strong>THE VAUGHAN WILLIAMS CLASSIFICATION- DRUGS</strong><br /><br /><p>***All antiarrythmic drugs are pro-arrythimic***

Classes reflect the type of receptor or channel that is blocked.

Mnemonic- for remembering which class does what:

Some-sodium channel blockers
Block-Beta-blockers
Pottasium- pottasium channel blockers
Channels- calcium channel blockers

Class 1- split into ABC

Class 1A- hardly used in practice. they prolong the repolarization and slow condution and therefore shift the whole action potential to the right. e.g- quinidine

Class 1B- shifts the action potental to the left. slows conduction and shortens repolarization. - lignocane

Class 1C- slows conduction with no effect on repolarization.- Flecanide- can NOT be used in patients with pre-exsisting cardiac disease or left ventricular dysfunction- can cause sudden cardiac death. This can be used as a chemical cardioverter in young patients.

Class II- beta blockers
Propanolol, Bisopralol, Atenolol- essentially work by slowing AV node conduction through reducing calcium entry into the AV node and therefore slowing ventricular rate. - -used in CCF and post MI
-do the opposite to what adrenaline would do to the heart- so reduce sympathetic stimulation
-beta blockers have a negative chronotropic (decrase the rate)
-decrase the force of contraction and therefore have a negative ionotropic reaction

Class III- potassium channel blockers
-Amioderone- need a LOADING DOSE because it binds to tissues and fats very heavily and irritates veins so must be put in through a CENTRAL VEIN
- known as the cardiac domestos as it can treat all arrhythmias
- side effects= thyroid dysfunction, pulmonary fibrosis, corneal deposits, slate grey appearance to the skin

Class IV- calcium channel blockers
-split into 2 groups
   - dihydropyradines- used for hypertension
   - non-dihydropiradines- rate limiting and therefore are used for cardiac dysrythmia - e.g. verapamil

Other Drugs
 - Atropine- used in bradyarrhythmias- increases heart rate
 - Adrenaline- used as a vasopressor in ppl in cardiac arrest
 - Digoxin- rate control for atrial fibrillation in pts with CCF
 - Adenosine- termination of super-ventricular tachycardias= v.horrible can give people a feeling of impending doom, and is an absolute contraindication is ASTHMA- use amioderone
 - Calcium chloride- used in dysrhythmia associated with hyperkalaemia= calcium glucanate</p>",5332,26,117,2012-12-31 15:47:26 UTC,2012-12-31 15:47:26 UTC
Drugs in Heart Failure,"<strong>DECOMPENSATED CARDIAC FAILURE</strong><br /><br /><p>-characterized by the acute onset of breathlessness
-signs of adrengenic activation= tachycardia
-pink sputum

Signs = bi-basal crepatations & gallop rhythm (S3,S4)

Treatment

Airway= secure

Breathing
-sit up
-oxygen

Circulation- IV access and bloods

Drugs
- aim is to vasodilate the patient
-morphine - 2.5.-5mg + antiemetic = metoclopramide
- GTN spray
-furosemide
- if this treatment fails to reduce breathlessness and control the pulmonary congestion may be useful to use IV nitrates</p><strong>CHRONIC CARDIAC FAILURE</strong><br /><br /><p>NYHA Classficiation
- Class 1:- asymptomatic
- Class 2:- slight limitation to physical activity -ON THE CLIMB
- Class 3:- moderate limitation - ON THE FLAT
- Class 4:- severe limitaton - AT REST

Conervative management
- treat any underlying problems e.g. HYT
- reduce salt
-graded exercise
-modify rf:- diet, smoking
- pneumococcal vaccination

Symptomatic treatment: DIURETICS
-  increase sodium excretion
-increase water loss
- decrease preload
-decrease congestion= systemic and pulmonary

-loop diuretics e.g. furosemide, bumetanide
-thiazide diuretics e.g.- bendroflurothiazide, metalazone

Preventing Death- ABSD
A- ace inhibitors: 
B- beta blockers
S-spirolactone
D-digoxin

Ace-inhibitors
-angiotension conversion enzyme inhibitors
-reduces preload and afterload= dereases activation of RAA system
- heart failure associated with chronic RAA activation
- use in HF based off the SAVE study
- start with a low dose and titrate u: the aim is to treat at the highest tolerable dose
- s/e: cough (20%)- due to inhibition of bradykinin, oedema, hyperkalemia (due to redueced aldosterone), renal failure (due to creatinine rise)
- absolute contraindication is renal artery stenosis
- if pt does get s/e e.g. cough then change to an angiotension receptor blocker

Angiotension Receptor Blockers
- AT1 receptor- reduce aldosterone and vasocontrition
-short acting- losartan
-long-acting- irbesartan, candersartan

-Val-HeFT - showed that valsartan better than placebo
-ELITE II study- losartan v.s. ACE showed no difference in end point

B-blockers
-now evidence base for use in HF
- start with a low dose and titrate up
- important side effects:- bronchospasm, cold extremities, bradycardia (particularly imp in terms of cardiac failure because can reduce cardiac output)

Spironolactone
- s/e that are important are gynaecomastia and hyperkalemia

Digoxin
- derived from the fox-glove plant
-increases the force of contraction of the myocardium
-reduces AV nodal coduction

indications
- co-exsisting AF- partiularly fast af as it allows for control of ventricular rate due to its AV nodal action

contraindication
- amioderone
-WPW

s/e
- toxicity= can cause severe dysrrythmias = characteristic reverse tick appearance on ECG
-nausea and vomiting</p>",5332,26,108,2012-12-31 15:47:25 UTC,2012-12-31 15:47:25 UTC

Rarer causes- subarachnoid haemorrhage, giant cell arteritis, space occupying lesion, post stroke, cluster headache, neuralgia, medication overuse.</strong><br /><br /><p>History- onset + progression, recurrent/new, site, associated symptoms, precip/relieving factors.
</p><strong>Tension Type Headache</strong><br /><br /><p>Muscular pain in scalp +neck. 70-90% life time incidence. Last hours-days. Frequency varies. Diffuse, dull aching headache. Associated with stress. No pther physical symptoms. Reduce stress + analgesics.</p><strong>Migraine</strong><br /><br /><p>Vascular process- serotonergic receptors, vascular spasm causes headache +focal neuro symptoms. 5-10% life time incidence. Onset early adult life. Classification:migraine without aura (SIMPLE), migraine with aura (CLASSICAL), Aura without migraine (Acephalic).
Aura is a neuro symptom, before migraine, flashing light, scintillating spectra(zigzag lines) sensory/motor disturbance. THROBBING headache, unilateral, N+V, 2-48 hours, freq = upto twice weekly. Alcohol, choc, cheese (tyramine diet), hormonal:COC, stress (fatigue, exercise, sleep deprivation) precipitate migraine.
Management- reduce precip factors, preventative b-blocker (propanolol) or serotonin antagonist (pizotifen), during attack ( paracetamol, nsaids, antiemetics, sumatriptan (5-HT agonists), steroids (diff cases)
Can get subtypes that have focal neurology. 
Basilar migraine= bilat visual loss, dysarthria, vertigo, paraesthesia, paresis. 
Hemiplegic= focal motor neurology (mistaken for stroke)
Opthalmoplegic= eye movement affected.

Endocrine Pathology I,"<strong>Endocrine Pathology</strong><br /><br /><strong>The Pituitary and the Adrenals</strong><br /><br /><p>Hormones are of two types: peptides/ proteins and steroids.
Peptides - cell surface-receptor interaction. Examples include insulin, GH, LH, FSH, ACTH
Steroids - nuclear-receptor interaction. Examples include oestrogens/progesterone, testosterone etc.</p><p>Generally diseases are due to excess hormone production, deficiency of hormone production or tumours (i.e. both, plus/minus a mass effect.</p><strong>The Pituitary</strong><br /><br /><p>Anterior: Fresh Pituitary Almost Tastes Like Guiness - FSH. Prolactin (dopamine). TSH (TRH). LH. ACTH (CRH). GH (GHRH) Posterior: ADH. Oxytocin</p><p>The most common disease of the anterior pituitary is the pituitary adenoma. Mostly however, these are non functional and remain very small, never coming to clinical attention. Functional adenomas make up 10% of all intercranial lesions. They are classified as micro (smaller than 1cm) or macro (bigger than 1cm). They are further classified by the hormines they release.</p><p>The most common hormones to be over produced are prolactin, causing amenorrhea and glactorrhoea. GH, causing gigantism and acromegaly. And corticotrophin (ACTH) causing Cushing's disease.</p><p>Deficiencies of pituitary hormones are most commonly caused by hypopituitarism (panhypopituitarism). Anteriorly, there are three common causes: the pituitary adenoma. ischaemic necrosis (Sheehan's syndorme - PPH. Or shock), or destruction due to trauma/surgery/irridiation. Usually these conditions lead to only very subtle clinical characteristics. In children, this is commonly pituitary dwarfism. In adults it depends on which are deficient.</p><p>Posterior problems:
1) Cranial Diabetes Inspidus. </p><p>Aetiology: head trauma, neoplasia and inflammation. Pathophysioloy: reduced secretion of ADH [anti-weeing hormone]. Leads to polyuria/polydipsia and normovolaemic hypernatraemia.</p><p>2) SIADH</p><p>Excessive and inappropriate ADH secretion. Excessive resorption of water, often with a normovolaemic hyponatraemia. Clinically this can result in severe cerebal oedema and associated CNS signs. Aetiology may include paraneoplasitc syndrome [secretion of ADH due to neoplasm, usually small cell carcinoma], cerebral infection [meningitis/encephalitis] or local injury to hypothalamus or pituitary.</p><p>Mass effects - include headache, worse in the morning and may be associated with vomiting. Bitemporal hemianopia (optic chiasm compression). Or diplopia - CN3,4 and 6 affected (cavernous sinuses - when compression spreads laterally).</p><strong>The Adrenals</strong><br /><br /><p>The adrenals may be divided into two distinct parts - the cortex (80%) and medulla (20%). The cortex is made up of the zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zoba reticularis. These produce aldosterone (following activation of the RAS), cortisol and androgens respectively. The medulla produces noradrenaline and adrenaline.</p><p>Pathology of the Cortex: hyperfunction</p><p>Excess GCS --> Cushings Syndrome. Excess aldosterone --> Conns. Excess androgens --> virilisation syndromes. Excess GCS can be exogenous, or endogenous. Exogenous due to steroid administration. Endogenous due to Cushings disease, an andrenal tumour/hyperplasia, or ectopic production - usually small cell carcinoma of the lung.</p><p>Excess aldosterone is associated with hypertension, and a hypokalaemia that is not associated with oedema or sodium overload (unexpectedly...perhaps?). The underlying reasons are complex. Excess aldosterone in Conn's stimulates excess reabsorbtion of sodium and water by the distal collecting tubules and ducts. The ECCF expands and blood pressure rises. However when the excess fluid represented by the rising blood pressure reaches a certain point, excretion of sodium and water by the kidney resumes, despite the raised aldosterone. This is called the 'escape phenomenen' and is mediated by ANP, secreted by the heart in response to excess stretching. Escape, however does not occur at the level of the distal collecting tubule, so high aldosterone levels stimulate continued exchange of sodium for potassium there, leading to a hypokalaemia.
Causes of hyperaldosteronism may be classified as primary or secondary. Primary (indicated by low levels of renin), may be due to bilateral hyperplasia (responds to aldosterone antagonist - spironolactone) or adrenal adenoma (must be removed surgically). Secondary (indicated by high levels of renin), must be due to RAS activation - often after reduced renal perfusion, arterial hypoperfusion.</p><p>Excess androgens lead to virilisation syndromes, and are more likely to be due to carcinomas than adenomas. But the most important pathology to be aware of is congenital adrenal hyperplasia - a group of autosomal recessive disorders affecting enzymes involved in corticol biosynthesis. [21 hydroxylase, 11-beta-hydroxylase, 17 alpha-hydroxylase etc.]</p><p>Adrenal Hypofunction - Addison's Disease.</p><p>SLOW onset. Usually patients do not present until both cortices have been destroyed. Causes may be primary or secondary. Primary causes include adrenal hypoperfusion (Waterhouse-Friedrichson syndrome in sepsis), steroid withdrawal, TB and autoimmune disease - an autoantibody to 21-hydroxylase. Secondary causes include a pituitary or hypothalamic lesion. The clinical presentation is that of hyperpigmentation (MSH), postural hypotension, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and hypoglycaemia. Ix include a random cortisol, an ACTH stimulating test, and treatment involves replacement of the missing factors (fludrocortisone, and hydrocortisone).</p><p>Neoplasms of the adrenals may be either adenomas or carcinomas. Most adenomas are non-functional, and carcinomas are exceedingly rare and generally associated with the virilising syndromes.</p><p>THE ADRENAL MEDULLA</p><p>The most important pathology is that of a pheochromocytoma, which is a neuroendocrine tumour of the cromaffin cells. Predictably these tumours secrete catecholamines, causing hypertension. RULE OF TENS! 10% MEN2, 10% bilateral, 10% maligant - only proved by the presence of mets, 10% extra-renal (paragangliomas).</p><p>What to do? 24 urine collection and a CT of the adrenals. Treatment involves surgery with medical preparation by an irreversible alpha blocker (phenoxybenzamine).</p><strong>The MEN Syndromes</strong><br /><br /><p>Common Features include young age, with multiple neoplasms. There are two types of MEN, both autosomal dominant. MEN 1 is associated with the tumour supressor MEN1 gene = the three P's! Parathyroid hyperplasia ---> renal canaliculi, Pituitary adenoma (prolactin secreting) ---> amenorrhoea and galactorea, and Pancreas insulinoma ---> recurrent hypoglycaemia. They are also associated with stomach ulcers in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.</p><p>MEN 2 syndromes are caused by mutations of the RET proto-oncogenes. There are two types. In type A there is inevitably phaeochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma. In type B there is the absence of hyperparathyroidism usually present in A, and there are extra-endocrine manifestations and ganglioneuromas.</p>",5285,5,28,2012-12-31 15:47:15 UTC,2012-12-31 15:47:15 UTC

Peripheral Arterial Disease,"<strong>Peripheral Arterial Disease</strong><br /><br /><strong>Atherosclerosis</strong><br /><br /><p>Results in a plaque in the wall of an artery that can directly obstruct bloodflow; it can also rupture to create an embolus that can obstruct more distal vessels. Patients with PAD usually present with intermittent claudication. There are several points to remember when considering taking a leg pain history:</p><p>1) Characterise pain: Usually a cramping, or tightening pain, affect calves, thighs or buttocks.</p><p>2) Beware other causes of leg pain (sciatica - pain on leaning/sitting forwards/getting up from seated) or (spinal stenosis, caused by narrowing of the spinal canal causing nerve compression - worse on spine extension). With claudication, the pain is only relieved by standing still. The other two only by sitting.</p><p>3) Establish how far the patient can walk (claudication distance), and whether the patient experiences night pain, or pain at rest.</p><p>4) There may be numbness, weakness, or presence of ulcers.</p><p>5) Ask about R/F for atherosclerotic disease - smoking, HTN, diabetes, high cholesterol, FH.

Lung Pathology,"<strong>Respiratory disease</strong><br /><br /><strong>Lung pathology</strong><br /><br /><p>There are four major areas in the lungs which undergo pathology, they are:
Pulmonary blood vessels
Airways
Lung parenchyma
Pleura

Lungs = organs of gas exchange. Function unit = alveoli. 

Two sets of airway:
Conducting airways (bronchi/bronchioles - first 16 generations)
Ventilatory/Acinus (all distal to terminal bronchiole)

Histology: Lungs lined by Pseudostratified epithelium, consisting of three important cell types:
1) Ciliated cells
2) Goblet cells (mucus secreting)
3) Neuroendocrine

These are all derived from basal cells (precursor cells).

End pathways in respiratory disease:
Hypoxia/respiratory failure - caused by ventilation perfusion mismatching (type 1 resp failure pco2 low) and alveolar hyperventilation (type 2 resp failure pco2 high)

Arterial blood gas to differentiate between them.

Resp failure defined as: arterial po2 of less than 8kpa. Dynamic process, patients moving in and out. (8kpa important as below 8kpa results in a big drop in oxygenated haemoglobin)

Type 1 resp failure:
Acute left vent failure
PE
Acute asthma
Pulmonary fibrosis
Severe pneumonia

Type 2 resp failure:
COPD
Neuromuscular disease
Severe acute asthma

Many conditions can cause both types, patients can swing between the two.

Respiratory failure can be acute or chronic depending on the cause. Chronic may be compensated and my present with fewer symptoms - sequale include pulmonary hypertension and polycythaeima, which is mediated by the kidneys  increasing production of erythropoietin and increased red blood cell production.

Bronchiectasis: Abnormal permanent dilatation of the airways, most effective 3rd/4th generation. Pathology: persistive destructive inflammation occuring in the walls of airways, leading to a self prepetuating cycle of destructing and infection. May be local or diffuse. Localised bronchiectasis is mostly due to tissue destruction e.g. a tumour, or sequelae to severe pulmonary infection, particularly in childhood. Diffuse bronchiectasis early is nearly always due to inherited conditions such as ciliary clearance problems and cystic fibrosis. 

Clincially there is a perisstent cough with purluent offensive green sputum.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome:
""sudden and severe lung damage""
Caused by: sepsis (severe pneumonia or septic shocks), severe trauma such as pulmonary or fractures or multiple blood transusions. 
3 important disruptions -  All involving the alveolar capillary barrier - fluid leaks into the alveolar spaces, causing pulmonary oedema. Fibrin leaks into the alevoli forming hyaline mebrane (look at hyaline membrane disease in neonatals). Surfactant is lost so alveolar collapse occurs. All of these contribute to a reudiction in gas exchange. Mortality in ARDS is around 50% and many of the rest may have severe morbidity and disability.</p>",5123,3,21,2012-12-31 15:46:50 UTC,2012-12-31 15:46:50 UTC
Basic Principles,"<strong>Cardiology</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong><br /><br /><strong>Basic principles</strong><br /><br /><p>Clinical features:

Common symptoms -
Chest pain*
Shortness of breath* (cardiac system = strong links with respiratory system)
Syncope (particularly arrythmias)
Ankle swelling

Signs:
Clubbing (Chronic hypoxia? Subacute infective endocarditis, congenital syonotic heart disease)

Pulse (Rate less than 60 vs >100, Rythm regular/irregularly irregular ((atrial fibrilation))/regularly irregular ((certain types of heart block)), character on brachial or carotid: slow rising or anachrotic pulse can be typical of aortic stenosis vs 'water-hammer' pulse typical of aortic regurgitation. Feel for a collapsing pulse: ask for pain in shoulder joint, lift arm with fingers over pulse.)

Blood pressure: Not only useful for hyper/hpotensive screen, pulse pressure can relate to same signs as character, e.g. a small pulse pressure can be of the same significance as a slow rising pulse in aortic stenosis, whereas a widened pulse pressure could be associated with the collapsing water hammer pulse of aortic regurgitation.

Jugular venous pressure: Elevated or not elevated? If it is visible, closer to the mastoid process or ear, then it's elevated.
Look at the extrenal jugulars, if they are engorged, they can also correspond with a raised JVP. SOB with basal crackles + raised JVP can signify pulmonary oedema/congestive cardiac failure.

Heart sounds: Can be broken down into the first and second heart sound. 1st timing corresponds to atrioventricular valves, 2nd sound corresponds to the aortic and pulmonary valves. As well as the sounds, murmurs can be auscultated, they can be systolic or diastolic. 

Lung sounds: Important to auscultate the lungs, listen to bases, look for bibasal crepetations which indicates fluid in the lungs. Important sign of pulmonary oedema, also look at the JVP and ankle/sacral/peripheral oedema, these features together can strongly suggest cardiac failure.

Constipation in Chilhood,"<strong>Epidemiology</strong><br /><br /><p>Common problem affecting between 5 and 30 % of children.

It is often accompanied by parental anxiety. It is typically characterised by infrequent bowel evacuations, large stools and difficult or painful evacuation. About a third of patients develop chronic symptoms and referral to secondary care is common.

</p><strong>Definitions</strong><br /><br /><p>The following terms were recommended by the Paris Consensus on Childhood Constipation Terminology (PACCT) Group in 2005 and they inform the diagnostic criteria.

In practice there are still children who have symptoms not adequately described by these terms.

    * Chronic constipation - 2 or more of the following in the preceding 8 weeks:
          o Fewer than 3 bowel movements per week.
          o More than one episode of faecal incontinence per week.
          o Either palpable stools in the abdomen, or large stools palpable rectally.
          o Passing stools so large they block the toilet.
          o Retentive posturing and withholding behaviours.
          o Painful defecation.
    * Faecal incontinence - passage of stool in inappropriate places:
          o Organic faecal incontinence - faecal incontinence resulting from organic disease.
          o Functional faecal incontinence - faecal incontinence without organic disease:
                + Constipation-associated faecal incontinence.
                + Non-retentive faecal incontinence - (no constipation associated). This is the passage of stools in inappropriate places in children over 4 years old with no evidence of constipation.
    * Faecal impaction - large faecal mass (abdominal or rectal and assessed by abdominal, rectal or other methods of examination) unlikely to be passed on demand.
    * Pelvic floor dyssynergia - the inability to relax the pelvic floor when attempting to defecate.</p><strong>CLinical Features</strong><br /><br /><p>    * History. In addition to general history (past medical history, school and social history and family history) the parent and child should be specifically questioned about the constipation. Parents can mistake incontinence for diarrhoea. In infants under 6 months, straining and crying for 10 minutes before passage of stools is caused by dyschezia (painful or difficult defecation which resolves spontaneously) and may be mistaken for constipation. Specific questions should cover:
          o The frequency of defecation.
          o Consistency of stools - this may include use of the Bristol Stool Chart.7
          o Episodes of faecal incontinence.
          o Pain on defecation.
          o Whether stools block the toilet.
          o Any associated behaviour.
      Any pain on defecation is likely to lead to withholding. Toddlers and older children get better at withholding.
    * Examination. This should include:
          o Palpation of the abdomen for faecal mass.
          o Inspection for anal stenosis or ectopia.
          o Looking for sacral abnormalities.
      Note:
          o Rectal examination is not routinely necessary or required.
          o Routine radiography is not recommended.</p><strong>Aetiology</strong><br /><br /><p>Most children have no underlying organic cause for constipation - that is they have functional constipation. Organic causes of constipation are found more frequently in infants under 1 year. Functional constipation is more frequent in children older than 1 year.


    * Rare organic causes include:
          o Hirschsprung's disease
          o Cystic fibrosis
          o Metabolic conditions for example, hypothyroidism
          o Neurological disability for example, cerebral palsy
          o Anorectal abnormalities.
       
    * Intolerance to cows' milk

Risk Factors

Common risk factors for constipation include:

    * Low fibre intake
    * Obesity.

There is no evidence for a difference in incidence between bottlefed and breastfed babies, although it is generally accepted that bottlefed babies are more at risk of fluid deficiency</p><strong>Treatment</strong><br /><br /><p>The aims of treatment are to:

    * Address any underlying causes of constipation for example, stop constipating medicines if possible, treat any painful anal condition, and address psychological causes
    * Treat acute constipation promptly to prevent it developing into chronic constipation
    * Clear any faecal impaction
    * Establish a regular pattern of bowel movements once or twice a day in which stools are soft and passed without discomfort
    * Prevent recurrence
    * Consider the needs and views of both the child and parents, alleviate blame, and encourage adherence to treatment. You can provide learning materials to help them manage the problems themselves.

Management plan

    * The following are important:Establishing rapport. This should take account of:
          o Anxiety of the parent and child.
          o Attitudes of guilt or blame.
          o Inappropriately coercive toilet training.
          o Social consequences (for example, faecal incontinence in older children).
      The clinician should take a positive approach which is sympathetic, non-accusatory and with careful explanations and continued involvement and follow-up.
    * Disimpaction. Retained faeces should be cleared from the rectum:
          o Initially, use an osmotic laxative, e.g polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 plus electrolytes (MovicolÂ® Paediatric Plain). This may increase symptoms (e.g. soiling) at first. Gradually increase the dose if ineffective.

            If not tolerated, substitute a stimulant laxative (see below) either on its own or with lactulose (osmotic laxative) or faecal softener (docusate) if stools are hard.9
          o If ineffective after 2 weeks add a stimulant laxative e.g. sodium picosulfate or senna in children over one month of age, docusate (softener and weak stimulant laxative) from 6 months of age or bisacodyl suppositories from 2 years of age.9 If success is not forthcoming, discuss with a paediatrician.
          o Rectal treatments should be avoided in children (suppositories, enemas, manual evacuation), although they may be recommended by specialists, and in hospital.
          o Review the child at least weekly until successful.9
    * Maintenance therapy. This may incorporate:
          o Dietary advice, including intake of fluids and fibre.
          o Use of bowel charts and diary for objective record.
          o Regular laxatives over months or even years, preferably osmotic (PEG 3350 or lactulose), titrated to maintain soft formed stool.
          o Avoiding stopping and starting treatment causing intermittent impaction.
          o Avoiding prolonged use of stimulant laxatives (causes atonic colon and hypokalaemia).
          o Using stimulant laxatives intermittently only to avoid impaction.
    * Modification of behaviour. Behavioural principles are useful in management. Specific behavioural modification techniques can be employed in specialist clinics.
      In general:
          o Encourage regular, unhurried toileting.
          o Encourage use of reward systems for successful use of the toilet.
          o Encourage linkage of diary to reward system.
    * Incontinence. Dealing with this requires:
          o Explanation to the parent and child of the involuntary nature of this.
          o Encouragement of regular toileting.
          o Involvement of the school nurse if possible to help with toileting and teacher education.
      There is no good evidence for psychological interventions despite some associations between incontinence and psychological problems.</p><strong>Complications</strong><br /><br /><p>Failure to correct functional constipation may lead to problems. For example, the following may arise:

    * Faecal impaction.
    * Chronic constipation.
    * Megacolon (may predispose to, or result from, constipation).
    * Rectal prolapse.
    * Anal fissure.
    * Faecal soiling.
    * Psychological effects.</p>",4848,22,,2012-12-31 15:46:08 UTC,2012-12-31 15:46:08 UTC
Orthopaedics Print,"<strong>Orthopaedicas</strong><br /><br /><strong>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</strong><br /><br /><p>Acute fatigue - fatigue that lasts less than one month - is usually due to a secondary symptom of a medical condition, for example an upper respiratory tract infection. At any one time, up to 25% of the general population report substantial fatigue that lasts for at least two weeks.

Chronic fatigue syndrome, however, is characterised by severe, disabling fatigue that lasts for at least six months, and also by other symptoms including musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, and headaches. Its cause is poorly understood.</p><strong>Diagnostic Criteria</strong><br /><br /><p>Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterised by severe, disabling fatigue and other symptoms, including musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, and headaches. The fatigue should be medically unexplained after a detailed clinical evaluation.

There are important differences between these definitions. The UK definition insists on the presence of mental fatigue, whereas the US definition includes a requirement for several physical symptoms, reflecting the belief that chronic fatigue syndrome has an underlying immunological or infective pathology.

The oxford criteria includes:

 - Severe diabling fatigue of at least 6 months duration that:
 - Affects both physical and mental functioning
 - Was present for more than 50 % of the time
 - Other symptoms, particualrly myalgia, sleep and  mood disturbance, may be present.
 - Also exclusion criteria fulfilled.


</p><strong>Organic and Functional Differential</strong><br /><br /><p>Anaemia

Thyroid Disorders

Diabetes

Addisons

Psychiatric disorders: Dementia, depression, anxiety, anorexia...</p><strong>Investigations</strong><br /><br /><p>Bloods: Recommended by NICE for exclusion of common medical causes of chronic fatigue (TATT):

    *  Urinalysis for protein, blood, and glucose
    * Full blood count
    * Urea and electrolytes
    * Liver function
    * Thyroid function
    * Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or plasma viscosity
    * C reactive protein
    * Random blood glucose
    * Serum creatinine
    * Screening blood tests for gluten sensitivity
    * Serum calcium
    * Creatine kinase
    * Assessment of serum ferritin levels (children and young people only)
    * Coeliac autoantibody screening (in the presence of gastro-intestinal symptoms only)
</p><strong>What about Depression?</strong><br /><br /><p>Depression is characterised by either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure that should be present for most of the day nearly every day for at least two weeks. The term ""atypical"" is sometimes used when there is hypersomnia instead of insomnia and an increase in appetite instead of a decrease.</p><strong>Prognosis</strong><br /><br /><p>Research has shown that in primary care chronic fatigue syndrome may have a favourable prognosis. The chances of recovery are high in people with depression. People without depression are even more likely to recover.</p><strong>Management</strong><br /><br /><p>Conservative: 

Research has found that a graded aerobic exercise programme, where participants increase their activity to up to 30 minutes of walking or swimming a day, improves measures of fatigue and physical functioning compared with flexibility training and relaxation training or general advice. You should not advise rest. In fact, prolonged rest has been found to have adverse effects in the long run. Although there are no systematic reviews or randomised controlled trials of prolonged rest in people with chronic fatigue syndrome, observational evidence suggests that prolonged inactivity may perpetuate or worsen fatigue and is associated with symptoms in healthy volunteers and in people recovering from viral illness

Medical: Research has shown that chronic fatigue syndrome may not respond to this type of routine medical management (e.g. TCAs). Instead, it requires a biopsychosocial approach
</p><strong>Follow Up</strong><br /><br /><p>If peresistent: There is evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy helps people with chronic fatigue syndrome. One systematic review found that cognitive behavioural therapy administered by highly skilled therapists in specialist centres improved quality of life and physical functioning compared with standard medical care or relaxation therapy</p><strong>Key Points</strong><br /><br /><p>

    * Unexplained chronic fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome are common conditions in primary care
    * Standard clinical and laboratory investigation is adequate for most patients presenting with chronic fatigue in primary care
    * The prognosis of chronic fatigue syndrome may be favourable in primary care; many patients can expect to recover in 12 months
    * Antidepressants are useful if a patient with chronic fatigue also has clinical depression
    * A key part of the GP's role is to provide patients with information and support

    *  I will try to do a mental state examination for all patients presenting with fatigue
    * I will do those laboratory investigations that exclude reasonably common causes of chronic fatigue
    * I will treat patients with chronic fatigue syndrome with antidepressants if they also have clinical depression

Paediatric Cardiology,"<strong>Foetal Anatomy</strong><br /><br /><strong>Antenatal</strong><br /><br /><p>Ductus Venosus connects the umbilical vein to the IVC, a sphincter regulates the flow. It carriers highly oxygenated blood.
Ductus Arteriosus diverts blood away from the lungs by allowing it to flow from the right ventricle through the pulmonary trunk but then across the duct into the aorta so it bypass the pulmonary arteries. It also allows the right ventricle to strengthen and dvelop properly. There is a low pulmonary blood flow and high vascular resistance.
</p><p>Foramen ovale. Just below the SVC, diverts blood from right to left atrium. Rich oxygenated blood straight into aorta. Works alonside ductus arteriosus.
At birth the ductus venosus sphincter constricts, diverting blood to the liver. This occlusion of the placental circulation causes an immediate drop in BP in the IVC and right atrium.</p><strong>ASD</strong><br /><br /><p>Normally closes due to pressure changes, 1/1500 births.

Chronic Visual Loss,"<strong>CHRONIC PAINLESS VISUAL LOSS</strong><br /><br /><strong>5 Important Causes</strong><br /><br /><p>1. Cataracts
2. Glaucoma
3. Diabetic retinopathy
4. Macular degeneration
5. Genetic eye disease</p><strong>Cataracts</strong><br /><br /><p>Opacities within the lens caused by crystallisation of crystalin found in the stroma of the lens.
It's the commonest cause of blindness worldwide.
Causes of cataracts can be split up into CONGENITAL and ACQUIRED:
CONGENITAL
- Autosomal dominant (25%)
- TORCH infections
- Maternal drug use during pregnancy e.g. steroids
- Metabolic conditions - galactosaemia, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia
- Chromosomal abnormalities - most commonly Downs and Turners

ACQUIRED - more commonly seen in the community
- Senility - senile cataracts
- Trauma - any penetrating injury to the eye or radiation
- Diabetes
- Drugs - most importantly steroids

HOW DO THESE PEOPLE PRESENT?
With a gradual reduction in VA
Increase in glaring - most commonly noticed when driving at night

Mx:
- Surgery - performed when the pts life is significantly affected. Phacoemulsification
- Complications - the complications of any surgical procedure. + those specific to this surgery. I.e. perforation of the back of the lens which can lead the vitreous moving forward which elevates the risk of retinal detachment; infection post op (endophthalmitis - it's really tricky to treat and may lead to blindness)

</p><strong>GLAUCOMA</strong><br /><br /><p>A term used to describe a group of conditions in which elevated IOP leads to visual damage

RISK FACTORS:
- Family history
- Female
- Myopia (short sighted)
- Afro-Caribbean

GLAUCOMA CAN BE DESCIRBED AS: ACUTE vs CHRONIC
ACUTE GLAUCOMA
- Rapid rise in IOP which leads to a painful red eye + sudden decrease in VA
CHRONIC GLAUCOMA
- Gradual rise in IOP which leads to damage to the optic nerve and painless loss of acuity (slowly)

GLAUCOMA CAN ALSO BE DESCRIBED AS: PRIMARY vs SECONDARY
PRIMARY
SECONDARY - occurs secondary to other eye diseases that obstruct drainage
- Inflammation e.g. uveitis
- Phacogenic (related to cataracts)
- Intraocular haemorrhage
- Drug induced e.g. steroids

GLAUCOMA MAY ALSO BE DESCRIBED AS: OPEN ANGLE vs CLOSED ANGLE
- this descirbes the drainage angle where the iris joins the cornea and where the circulating fluid in the anterior and posterior chamber move through the trabecular mesh work and into the canal of Schlemm

PRIMARY OPEN ANGLE GLAUCOMA
- this is the most common form and is due to reduced drainage through the trabecular meshwork. This leads to chronic glaucoma with the characteristic peripheral vision loss before central visual loss

PRIMARY CLOSED ANGLE GLAUCOMA
- Due to reduced drainage as the lens is pushing forward on the trabecular meshwork. Hypermetropics (long sighted) are at a particular risk as the have a shallow anterior chamber. This usually presents acutely as acute glaucoma with a painful red eye and altered vision. MEDICAL EMERGENCY

SECONDARY GLAUCOMA
OPEN-ANGLE vs CLOSED ANGLE (closed angle quite rare)
- can occur in various eye conditions
- Inflammation e.g. uveitis
- Phacogenic (related to cataracts)
- Intraocular haemorrhage
- Drug-induced e.g. steroids

CLINICAL FEATURES:
apart from acute glaucoma, it's usually pretty asymptomatic
However there are some features to look for....
- elevated IOP > 22mmHg
- Disc cupping (cup:disc >0.6)
- Arcuate scotoma
- Tunnel vision

MANAGEMENT:
Medical - eye drops - basically they all alter the production of aqueous humour within the eye and therefore reduced the pressure. Inc beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, prostaglandin analogues (e.g. lumagen), myotics

If medical therapy fails then onto surgical mx
Surgical - laser trabeculoplasty (a high energy laser is used to shrink down parts of the trabeluar meshworks to allow other parts of the meshwork to stretch, open up and allow the humour to drain), trabeculectomy (in this procedure, an opening in the sclera is made and a small piece of the trabecular meshwork is removed), drainage implants

ACUTE CLOSED ANGLE GLAUCOMA
Medical emergency, get help from a specialist pronto
- Mx with eye drops and iridotomy (a hole in the iris is made and allows fluid to move more freely from anterior to posterior sides)</p><strong>DIABETIC RETINOPATHY</strong><br /><br /><p>Very common and usually occurs in diabetics >10yrs after dx
3 characteristic stages:
1. background retinopathy (these ppl have normal vision)
- microaneurysms
- dot and blot haemorrhages
- hard exudates (reflects lipid leakage into the retina)
HOWEVER it's important to be aware that there's a form of background retinopathy called cystoid macular oedema aka diabetic maculopathy where there is a loss of VA associated with these changes . These changes with this condition however usually at the macula
2. preproliferative retinopathy
- cotton wool spots aka soft exudates. These represent areas of ischaemia in the nerve fibre layer [Soft exudates are also known as cotton wool spots and represent areas of arteriolar occlusion with associated ischaemic changes in the nerve fibre layer]. There's also a reduction in the capillary network. Rx of preproliferative retinopathy is controversial with most ophthalmologists suggesting no rx instead mx by increase in examination frequency and an improvement in diabetic control
3. Proliferative retinopathy - this is where chronic ischaemia in the retina drives new vessel formation . However these vessels are leaky and this leakiness can cause haemorrhage, fibrosis and tractional detachment. Rx = ?retinal laser photocoagulation which abolishes the production of angiogenic factors from the ischaemic retina

Other eye changes to be aware of in DR inc:
- Fluctuating VA. Secondary to short episodes of hyperglycaemia
- Cataracts
- Formation of mononeuropathies resulting in diplopia (CNIII)
- Diabetic papillopathy which usually occurs bilaterally in type 1 patients. There's mild visual loss in association with disc swelling, macular oedema and exudates. Most pts will improve in 6months following improvement in their diabetic control</p><strong>Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)</strong><br /><br /><p>= the commonest cause of blindness in the western world. 
It's characterised by spotting of DRUSEN. 
- Yellow/white accumulations of extracellular material in Bruch's membrane. 
- Pathological in the young
Drusen is now thought to be a normal age related process and is seen individuals of 90 or 100yo. However in individuals younger than this it can cause various problems. 

Loss of vision in this condition is due to complications...there's 2:
- Dry AMD (geographic atrophy)
- Wet AMD (sub-retinal neovascularisation)

1. Dry AMD (more common)
- basically what happens here is that the macular region wears away.
- Characterised clinically by:
Slow decline in vision over many years
Central > peripheral acuity loss
Rx: visual aids

2. Wet AMD
- resulting in rapid deterioration in vision. Usually over weeks - days
Rx: can be treated with laser photocoagulation </p><strong>GENETIC EYE DISEASE</strong><br /><br /><p>Specifically going to talk about RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA as this is the most common condition.

Retinitis Pigmentosa = represents a group of progressive inheritied conditions affecting the photoreceptors of the retina. I.e. in the retinal pigment epithelium
- It may be inheritied in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked fashion
- affetcs 1/4000 indiviuals
- it's bilateral and symmetrical! IF one were to see the changes of RP unilaterally in an asymmetrical fashion, one would think of choroiditis. 

The two characteristic clinical features of RP:
- Night blindness
- Tunnel vision

This is a progressive condition. Most people will be registered blind by there early 20s

Ophthalmoscopy features a triad of signs:
- bone spicule pigmenting
- blood vessel attenuation
- optic atrophy 

There are two eponymous syndromes to be aware of that include the features of RP but other things as well:
USHER SYNDROME (most common eponymous association, affecting one in 5 RP pts)
- RP + deafness

BARDET-BIEDEL DISEASE
- Characterised by extra toes and entrapment neuropahties
- RP+polydactly+obesity+entrapment neuropathies

LASTLY
There are two other important conditions to be aware of if I see a kid who has lost their vision:
- Stargart disease. An autosomal recessive form of juvenile macular degeneration
- Best's disease. Hereditary form of progressive macular dystrophy.

Exposure - 

</p><strong>Airway</strong><br /><br /><p>When I come to A I need to be able to answer the following:
- Is their airway safe and maintained?

Some causes of an unsafe airway include:
- Reduced GCS: any cause inc drugs, alcohol, head injury
- Foreign body obstruction: could be anything inc the patient's own secretions or vomitus
- Airway swelling: commonly due to anaphylaxis

If I think there airway is unsafe then I need to do something before moving onto breathing:
BASIC MANEOUVERS
- Head tilt, chin lift
- Jaw thrust if C-spine injury is possible
- Could also suction them or put them on their side I think secretions or blood etc are the cause of airway obstruction

AIRWAY ADJUNCTS
- Guedel's airway = oropharyngeal airway
- Naropharyngeal airway
- Supraglottic airway: LMA, combitube

DEFINITIVE AIRWAYS
- ETT
- Tracheostomy tube

Once I'm happy that they have a patent airway (either becuase the patient has secured it themselves or because I've used the above tricks) then I can move onto breathing!!</p><strong>BREATHING</strong><br /><br />",4382,24,99,2012-12-31 15:45:13 UTC,2012-12-31 15:45:13 UTC

1. LIDS
2. CONJUNCTIVA
3. SCLERA
4. CORNEA
5. ANTERIOR CHAMBER

The causes that do not necessarily need urgent referral:
- conjunctivitis
- subconjunctival haemorrhage
- episcleritis

The conditions that do need urgent same day referral:
- corneal ulcers
- acute glaucoma
- anterior uveitis
- scleritis
- enopthlamitis

4 red flag symptoms to help prompt me to think about these conditions:
- disturbance of vision - blurring
- sticky discharge from the eye
- cloudy cornea
- involvement of the pupil

1. LIDS
- mechanical
foreign body - usually gets trapped under the subtarsum
- inflammatory
blepharitis - either anterior or posterior. Anterior affects the lids, posterior affects the Meiobiam glands causing a chalazion (aka a stye)
- infection
Preseptal cellulitis - fairly mild and can be treated with antiobiotics and steroidals
Orbital cellulitis - v. serious gelsie. Painful and requires admission for CT scan of the sinuses and IVAbs

2. Conjunctiva
- Mechanical - subconjunctival haemorrhage usually associated with trauma. 
- Inflammatory - allergy, pts who are known atopics with asthma or eczema and have itchy eyes should be considered to have this condition
- Infection - COMMON. may be bacterial, viral or chlamydia. Ocular irritation. D/c which is watery in viral and purulent in bacterial. There may be associated preauricular lymphadenopathy
3. Sclera
- Mechanical - trauma.
- Inflammation - 
episcleritis - pts have mild reddening of the sclera
scleritis - severe redenning of the entirety of the sclera - described as beefy red
- Infection - nil important ones
4. Cornea
- Mechanical - abrasions, foreign bodies, chemical injuries [irrigate the eye]
- Inflammation - MELTS.
- Infection - keratitis. Microbial keratitis may be bacterial, fungal or ameobic. Virally the most common causes are HSV, HZV. Important risk factor for the development of keratitis is the use of contact lenses + poor hygeine
4. Anterior chamber
- Mechanical - acute glaucoma - usually there is a an acute decline in VA combined with severe pain usually in ocular and periocular region. The condition is more common in ppl who are long sited. It occurs due to closure of the angle, and results in massive increases in IOP. Important appearances include a cornea which is cloudy in appearance, a pupil which is oval and mid dilated. OPTHALMIC EMERGENCY! 
- Inflammatory - uveitis - describes inflammation of the uveal tract which may be anterior or posterior. Anterior uveitis is the one that usually presents with pain, photophobia, a red eye as well as decreased vision. It may be idiopathic but may be associated with some specific conditions including HLAB27 assocaited conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, IBD, Reiter's syndrome, sarcoid, Betchets disease, various infections including TB, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, HIV and malignancy - specifically: non-hogkins lymphoma, leukaemia, retinoblastoma, ocular melanoma
- Infection - enopthalmitis - has a characteristic appearance</p>",4382,14,,2012-12-31 15:45:13 UTC,2012-12-31 19:16:08 UTC

20% present acutely and will have recurrent episodes 
20% develop a chronic illness that starts acutley
20% will develp a chronic illness that starts insidiously
10-15% will commit suicide
Favourable prognostic factors; acute presentation, high IQ, high social class and being female
</p><strong>aetiology</strong><br /><br /><p>Multifactorial; genetics and environment
If one sibiling has the condition 10-15% chance of developing the condition
If both your parents are schizophrenic; 40% chance of developing the condition
Environmental factors; lower social class, pregnancy complications and cannabis use, multiple adverse live events
Neurodevelopmental factors; CT/MRI abnormalities in the temporal lobes</p><strong>Presentation</strong><br /><br /><p>There are two main types
1) Acute syndrome; mainly positive symptoms; alterations in each of the MSE components. Behaviour; restless noisy, restless or withdrawn. Mood; change in the mood, blunting and incongruenty of affect. Speech; pressure, poverty of speech or thought blocking. Thinking; functional thought disorder i.e. loosening associations, word salad and delusions. Perceptions; hallucinations are prominent auditory>visual. Cognition; Impaired with time, especially with executive function. Lack of insight. 
2) Chronic syndrome; mainly negative symptoms. Triad of; lack of drive social withdrawal and impaired living skills. Note; movement disorders aka kataonic symptoms. i.e. stupor; patient immobile mute and unresponsive</p><strong>Diagnosis</strong><br /><br /><p>Altered by a number of factors. 
Increase age; increase incidence of paranoia and decreased behavioural symptoms
More severe in females and those with high emotional expression plus over/under stimulation
Compliated; schinders first rank symptoms; passivity, thought possesion, delusional perception, hallucinations (commentry, third person or thoughts).There usually requires social impairment and ICD 10 criteria 1 month and DSM 4 ~ 6 months
Usually diagnosed earlier but other psychoic mood disorders and organic causes have to be ruled out first.</p><p>A prominent affective component i.e. manic or depressive; psychzoaffective disorder
Isolated delusions; delusional disorder
</p><strong>Treatments</strong><br /><br /><p>Exclude other diagnosis/requirement for admission
Most important drugs used are behavioural modifiers i.e. BZD, anti-psychotics which have some immediate behavioural action but may take upto 3 weeks to fully work. ECt if depressive symptoms or 2 espisodes of stupor

If patient recovers it is usual to continue anti-psychotic for a minium of 6 months. If don't recover; MDT care plan package and reassesment every 6 months; dosage and s/e; weight gain, dyskinesia and hypergylceamia.

Pre-op Assessment,"<p>Initially there is a pre assessment clinic run by nurses and then referred to consultant anaesthetist if any risks.
Risks to high ----consider nerve block/local etc 

Obs performed in the morning by the nurse on the day of the op patient must be haemodynamically stable. 
Height and weight are most important in paediatric cases when doses need to be carefully measured out.
</p><strong>ASA grade</strong><br /><br /><p>1 = completely fit and well, no medical conditions
2 = mild systemic disease, doesnât affect life e.g: hayfever, eczema (or over 80)
3 = severe systemic disease causes limited effect on life - COPD
4 = severe systemic disease constant threat to life
5 = moribund, high risk of mortality from anaesthetic

For elective surgery = usually grade 1 or 2, occasionally 3.
</p><strong>Past medical history:</strong><br /><br /><p>-	Rheumatoid arthritis ---some form of neck involvement (atlantoaxial subluxation) difficult for intubation
-	Obstructive sleep apnoea/ on CPAP â may have difficult airway, issues with hypoxia
</p><strong>Drug history:</strong><br /><br /><p>Some must be omitted before/after surgery. Tolerance to analgesics if on high doses (can produce pain issues).</p><strong>Previous anaesthetic history:</strong><br /><br /><p>If they havenât had an anaesthetic have their family, any problems with family. 
Have they had anaesthetic before.
</p><strong>Alcohol/tobacco/recreational drugs:</strong><br /><br /><p>Quitting smoking even days before operation has good effect.
If patient is heroin addict etc the morphine may not touch them â need a higher dose.
</p><strong>Allergies:</strong><br /><br /><p>Check for NSAIDS etc</p><strong>Loose teeth, caps or crowns???</strong><br /><br /><strong>Airway =  Mallam patti score:</strong><br /><br /><p>1 = whole uvula
2 = part of uvula
3 = soft palate
4 = only hard palate (hard to intubate)

A = cannot bring bottom teeth inline with top
B = can bring inline but not further forward
C = can bring inline and further forward (this is the best)
Can add the AB or C to mallam patti score
</p><strong>Examination:</strong><br /><br /><p>CVS -----any murmurs??? Must be investigated before op
RS -----any crackles or signs of infection (avoid op)
</p><strong>Investigations:</strong><br /><br /><p>ECGs and X rays = not routine unless previous CVS history or over 60, X rays usually part of surgical â rheumatoid may want cervical x ray.

-	Trauma following shouting (usually clears up week or 2) âalso prolonged ET intubation
-	Chronic laryngitis = men who drink, smoke and shout a lot in pubs.
-	Singers nodules/clergymans throat = overuse or abuse of the voice â small disappear with voice rest others need to be removed surgically
-	Recurrent Laryngeal nerve palsy â cause??? Descends through jugular foramen, alongside pharynx passes round ligamentum arteriosum. Cerebral tumours, carcinoma of nasopharynx, large thyroid carcinomas or surgery, malignant disease in oesophagus, bronchus or hilar lymph nodes (only affects left laryngeal nerve)

The Nose,"<strong>Function</strong><br /><br /><p>-	Breathing  - moistens, warms and filters the air (lower 2/3) --- 3 conchi/turbinants (superior, middle, inferior)
-	Smell â mainly upper third
 
Sinuses = 
Frontal/maxillary (drainage port lies high on the wall therefore drainage = poor and sinusitis is common here) /ethmoid---- drains through superior meatus/sphenoid
</p><strong>Epistaxis</strong><br /><br /><p>What is the source of bleeding
-	Young children = usually littles area(inside nose on septum) â from nose picking. Treat by pressing on this area until bleeding has stopped. If recurrent may need cautery with silver nitrate. 
-	Adults = also littles area â usually due to mild trauma to mucocutaneous vein â treat with pressure and cautery
-	Elderly = high up and far back is the source. Sit the patient, put ice on the nose âcauses vasospasm and stops bleeding. If doesnât stop may need packing and Simpsons balloon.
</p><strong>Nose trauma:</strong><br /><br /><p>4 main types;
-	Soft tissue injury = bruising and laceration(dress and suture)
-	Displacement of nasal septum = may need op
-	Haematoma of nasal septum = collection of blood between perichondrium and septal cartilage â disrupts cartilage blood supply ---fibrosis and necrosis ----saddling of the nose. Boggy dusky blue swelling which needs drainage
-	Fractures
o	Flatten fracture 
o	Lateral deviated
At the time fix by manipulating but usually present later â need to wait 7-10 days for swelling to go down, assess and then do the surgery later. 
</p><strong> Deviated nasal trauma:</strong><br /><br /><p>Septum is over curved which leads to nasal blockage (usually bilateral due to compensatory swelling). SMR can be performed.</p><strong>Catarrh</strong><br /><br /><p>Excess mucous production. Usually due to increased tissue fluid ---swelling of mucous membranes and blockage and fullness, increased nasal fluid. 
-	Allergic catarrh = mast cell degranulation and histamine release. Suspect if symptoms are seasonal or all year (dust mite) or atopy history
-	Vasomotor = arteriolar end of capillary which supplies the nose is under control of ANS = sympathetic constricts and parasympathetic dilates. Therefore any cause of increased parasympathetic or reduced sympathetic causes this ---antihypertensives, emotional, temperature etc
TREATMENT:Avoid precipitants! 
-	Steroids
-	Nasal cromoglicate
-	Antihistamines

There are four genes and severity depends on number deficient.
-	4 = incompatible with life (hydrops fetalis)
-	3 = moderate anaemia and splenomegaly (HbH disease)
-	1 or 2 = asymptomatic with mild anaemia
Beta thalassemia:
Mostly point mutations, over production of alpha chains.
-	Major = homozygous (cooleys anaemia)
present during the first year and need blood transfusion
o	Severe anemia 3-6 months
o	Extramedullary haemopoeisis = hepatosplenomegaly and bony expansion
o	Bony deformities ---frontal bossing, easy fractures
o	Iron accumulation âdiabetes, failure of sexual development, hepatic and cardiac dysfunction (usually due to repeated transfusions)
-	Minor/intermedia = heterozygous
mild
</p><strong>Acquired haemolysis = </strong><br /><br /><strong>Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia:</strong><br /><br /><p>Production of antibodies against red cells leads to red cell haemolysis. Both intravascularly and extravascularly. Associated with other autoimmune diseases. May be seen with drugs and other haemolytic disorders.
-	Features of haemolysis
-	Positive DAT test (direct antiglobulin test/coombs test)
Warm: 
-	37
-	More common
-	IgG mediated 
-	Causes = idiopathic, autoimmune disorders, myeloproliferation (CLL, lymphoma), drugs
Cold:
-	Under 37
-	IgM mediated 
-	Causes = infections (EBV, mycoplasma), lymphoma
Features = 
-	Those of chronic anaemia or acute episodes
Treatment = 
-	Steroids to induce remission 
-	Immunosuppression if relapse
-	Splenectomy if it does not improve with steroid but not effective for those with cold as most cells are destroyed in the liver rather than spleen
</p><strong>Non immune haemolysis:</strong><br /><br /><p>Trauma in narrow, damaged vessels.
-	Artificial heart valves 
-	Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia = DIC, HUS, TTP
-	March haemoglobinuria 
Features = schistocytes on blood film
</p><strong>Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria = </strong><br /><br /><p>Acquired mutation of PIGa gene in stem cells -----red cell defect which leads to inability to make GPI = surface anchor proteins. All cell lines are affected.
Triad of:
-	Intravascular haemolysis
-	Venous thrombosis
-	Haemoglobulinuria (night/morning)
Diagnosis = 
-	Flow cytometric analysis = anti CD55 and anti CD59
Treatment = 
Supplementation (folate) and anticoagulation
monoclonal antibodies â act against complement components to decrease complement mediated haemolysis

Very common - up to 40% of 16-18 year olds.
Affects pilosebaceous units - in the head and upper trunk mainly.</p><strong>Aetiology</strong><br /><br /><p>- increased formation of keratin within the hair follicle
- leads to blockage and micro-comedone formation 
- inflammatory activity follows surrounding comedone - due to p acnes 
- bacterial lipases form fatty acids driving inflammation

Medical = stepwise approach
- first line = benzyl peroxide = topical retinoids tretinoin alternative  (can cause skin irritation) wash hands after application can stain.
- second line = topical antimicrobial creams (where successful use for at least 6 months)
- oral antibiotics = moderate to severe acne - oxytetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline. unresponsive to topical therapy. reassess after 3 months.
- oral isotretinoin (retinoid) = roacutane - inhibits sebaceous gland function. But teratogenic, hepatitis and abnormal lipid profile are side effects. Need to be under consultant.</p>",4200,13,177,2012-12-31 15:44:51 UTC,2012-12-31 15:44:51 UTC

HCO3 is alkalotic
Changes in CO2 are RESPIRATORY
Changes in HCO3 are METABOLIC</p><strong>Look at CO2</strong><br /><br /><p>Is the CO2 ABNORMAL AND IN LINE WITH THE pH?
Remember, High CO2 in acidosis, low CO2 in alkalosis.

So if the CO2 is ABNORMAL and REFLECTS pH, the problem is RESPIRATORY in nature. If the change in CO2 is OPPOSITE to what you would expect for the pH then there is respiratory compensation for a metabolic problem.</p><strong>LOOK AT BICARB</strong><br /><br /><p>Remember, high bicarb should give an alkalosis, low bicarb should give an acidosis.

Is the bicarb abnormal and in line with the pH?
If yes, metabolic problem.
If opposite to what you expect, there is metabolic compensation.</p><strong>BASE EXCESS</strong><br /><br /><p>Basically, if there is a high base excess, there is additional base (alkali) required to neutralise an acidosis. Don't need it to establish respiratory acid/alkalosis or metabolic acid/alkalosis.</p><strong>Calculating the Anion Gap</strong><br /><br /><p>(Na + K) - (Cl + HCO3) = 8-12mmol/L

Used to identify whether the acidosis is due to retention of H+ or to another acid.
High- indicates increased unmeasured anions, eg lactic acidosis, ketones in DKA, drugs eg poisons, methanol, end stage renal failure.

Met Acidosis + Normal AG

Jaundice,"<strong>Jaundice</strong><br /><br /><strong>Bilirubin Metabolism</strong><br /><br /><p>Derived from breakdown products of haemoglobin from senescent RBCs. 
Initially it is unconjugated and INSOLUBLE in water, and so circulates in the blood bound to albumin until it is taken up by the liver.
Bilirubin undergoes conjugation in liver (by glucuronyl transferase) to form conjugated bilirubin, which is water soluble. This is then secreted into the bile ducts.
Bacteria in the gut convert bilirubin into urobilinogen, which is excreted as stercobilinogen in the stool or reabsorbed into the bloodstream and either metabolised by the liver or excreted in urine.</p><p>Jaundice occurs when levels of bilirubin in the blood become abnormally raised.
This may be due to:
- increased bilirubin production
- impaired bilirubin metabolism
- impaied bilirubin excretion
Excess bilirubin deposits in tissues, giving rise to the symptoms and signs of jaundice --> yellow skin and sclera.</p><strong>Approach to Jaundice</strong><br /><br /><p>Prehepatic: Things that occur before the liver. Increase in the amount of unconjugated bilirubin.
Haemolysis:
Inherited: spherocytosis etc
Acquired: haemolytic anaemia, HUS, TTP etc
Jaundice with haemolysis sometimes described as ""lemon tinge"", as patients have pallor from anaemia, with yellow of jaundice on top.
</p><p>Hepatic:
Hepatitis (eg viral, autoimmune, drug induced).
Cirrhosis, especially in decompensated cirrhosis. Jaundice is an important sign of decompensation in cirrhotic patients.
Malignancy- primary or secondary.
Inherited defect in bilirubin metabolism- Gilbert's syndr (inherited defect in glucuronyl transferase), Crigler Najjar syndr (like Gilbert's but presents in children and is more severe).</p><p>Posthepatic. BILIARY SYSTEM.
Luminal: eg gallstones
Mural: tumour/stricture. PSC, repeated procedures, eg ERCP.

Ongoing mgmnt, establish cause, eg AF, ECG, CXR - could they have aspiration pneumonia following dysphagia secondary to stroke. CT urgently to exclude haemmorhage. Carotid dopplers- if signif carotic stenosis on same side as stroke, then carotid endarterectomy.
Physio/OT key to improve fxn post stroke, and decrease morbidity</p><strong>Pharmacological management</strong><br /><br /><p>Interested in reducing risk of recurrence.
Diabetic? optimise glycaemic control
TED stocking to decrease DVT/PE risk. Use these initially instead of heparin because those who have recently suffered an ischaemic stroke are at greater risk of haemorrhage.
BP may rise significantly in forst 48hrs in order to improve circulation to rest of brain- want to avoid antihypertensives in acute phase.

Thrombolysis: same principles as in MI.

Renal Medicine in 50 minutes,"<strong>Renal Medicine: The Basics</strong><br /><br /><strong>Renal Pathology</strong><br /><br /><p>Problems? Think anatomically!
Pre-renal (blood vessels)
Renal (3 key structures: Glomerulus, tubules and interstitium.)
Post Renal (Outflow tracts)</p><strong>Pre-Renal: Blood Flow and Blood Vessels</strong><br /><br /><p>Blood flow:
Hypoperfusion- insufficient blood supply to the kidneys
The number 1 cause of kidney probs!
Insufficient blood supply to the kidneys
Not enough urine produced to perform key function of the kidney
USUALLY REVERSIBLE, so eg in patient in shock, give fluids to increase circulating volume and hopefully they'll start perfusing kidneys again.
If prolonged, can lead to acute tubular necrosis
</p><p>Blood vessels:
HYPERTENSION- perhaps the most common cause of kidney failure (esp in western world). Thickening of vessel walls (small muscular arteries/ arterioles- think RENAL ARTERIOLES). Leads to luminal narrowing, chronic ischaemia, gradual loss of nephrons and renal failure.
ATHEROSCLEROTIC RENAL DISEASE- think larger vessels, eg renal arteries
Renal artery stenosis
Typical patient = ARTERIOPATH
Disease due to: 
Ischaemic nephropathy (hypoperfusion, so not enough oxygen delivery to the kidneys, which on a chronic basis leads to loss of tubules.)
Secondary hypertension (RAA-mediated)
So both of these will lead to hypertension.
</p><strong>RENAL: GLOMERULAR DISEASE</strong><br /><br /><p>Glomerulus = knot of capillaries (capillary tuft) projecting in to Bowman's capsule, supported by network pof connective tissue (mesangium). The glomerulus is the site of ULTRAFILTRATION, where solutes within blood are filtered.</p><p>Glomerulonephritis: ""Injury +/- inflammation of the glomeruli"".
Primary: Idiopathic
Secondary: Another disease process
DAMAGE --> leakage of protein/blood (because ultrafiltration at glomerulus is impaired):
Nephritic and Nephrotic syndromes
Associated conditions:
Lupus
Diabetes mellitus
Amyloidosis
Infections (malaria, hep B, streptococcal)
Vasculitis (Wegner's)
Malignancy
Drugs
</p><p>SUBTYPES OF GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
1. Membranous glomerulonephritis: Nephrotic syndrome in adults. Common
2. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: Nephrotic syndrome in adults. Less common.
3. Minimal change disease: Child with nephrotic syndrome. Excellent Rx to steroids
4. IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease): Young male with recurring haematuria. Common.
5. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis: Post-infective, children/young adults. Rare in west.</p><strong>RENAL: TUBULAR DISEASE</strong><br /><br /><p>TUBULAR DISEASE:
Acute Tubular Necrosis (what happens with chronically underperfused kidneys).
Most common condition of tubules.
Occurs with: ISCHAEMIA (prolonged decrease in perfusion)
Toxins: Myoglobin, Haemaglobin (malaria), Drugs (gentamicin, contrast).

BEWARE! PRE-RENAL FAILURE CAN CAUSE RENAL FAILURE (ATN)

Other tubular disorders:
Very rare
1. Excessive loss of substances: Glucose, amino acids, phosphate; Glucosuria aminoaciduria, cystinuria
2. Inadequate excretion of substances: Renal tubular acidosis
</p><p>INTERSTITIAL DISEASE
Interstitial Nephritis- can divide into acute and chronic.
ACUTE
Acute Renal Failure: Type 1 hypersensitivity response (degranulation of mast cells, releasing IgE)
-Antibiotics (Penicillins/cephalosporins)
-NSAIDS
-Diuretics
CHRONIC
Chronic Renal Failure: Persistent inflammation and fibrosis
-NSAIDS</p><p>PYELONEPHRITIS- extreme complication of UTI, where infxn has ascended from bladder to kidneys
ACUTE- ascending infection.
Unwell patient, loin pain + dysuria, renal failure (especially in children with recurrent UTIs)
CHRONIC/REFLUX NEPHROPATHY
Vesicoureteric reflux. Unilateral --> hypertension. Bilateral --> Chronic Renal Failure (children and young adults)</p><strong>POST-RENAL: OUTFLOW TRACT DISEASE</strong><br /><br /><p>Think things that cause obstruction, and backpressure up to the kidneys
Stones, Malignancy (bladder/ureters), Prostatic hypertorphy, Chronic urinary retention, inflammation (retro-peritoneal fibrosis, which causes tethering of ureters and affects drainage).</p><strong>PRESENTATION / INVESTIGATIONS</strong><br /><br /><strong>RENAL: INTERSTITIAL DISEASE</strong><br /><br /><p>Presentation not very specific.
Non-specific features of renal disease:
Malaise, fatigue, may or may not have urinary symptoms (anuric, polyuric, oliguric etc)
Features of underlying cause is often more obvious, so that's the thing to look for!</p><p>2 KEY SYNDROMES!
Nephrotic Syndrome= A triad of:
1. Proteinuria (>3.5g per day)
2. Hypoalbuminaemia
3. Oedema
Associated with hyperlipidaemia, reduced immunity (due to loss of protein, inc immunoglobulins) and hypercoagulability (due to loss of intrinsic anticoagulants).
Characteristic feature= PERIORBITAL OEDEMA, can see peripheral oedema, ascites and bilateral pleural effusions if VERY SEVERE.
Manifestation of GLOERULAR DISEASE.</p><p>CAUSES OF NEPHROTIC SYNDROME:
Adults:
Diabetic nephropathy
Membranous glomerulonephritis
focal segmental glomerulonephritis
Children:
Minimal Change Disease (which responds very well to steroids)</p><p>Nephritic Syndrome = a triad of:
1. Proteinuria (ess than nephrotic)
2. Haematuria
3. Fluid overload (does cause oedema but ACUTE ONSET so usually fills up lungs, around eyes).
Key clinical feature= brown/coca cola coloured urine (due to haematuria)</p><p>CAUSES OF NEPHRITIC SYNDROME
ADULTS:
IgA nephropathy
CHILDREN/YOUNG ADULTS
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, where strep throat infxn leads to acute response and glomerulonephritis.</p><strong>ACUTE vs CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE</strong><br /><br /><p>Really common.
ARF
Rapid loss of glomerular function (hours/days)
Rise of creatinine to less than 50% pre-morbid fxn
Problems:
1. Uraemia
2. Failure of fluid balance (fluid overload, usually manifests in pulmonary oedema)
3. Failure of electrolyte regulation (hyperkalaemia)
4. Failure of acid-base balance (acidosis)</p><p>CAUSES:
PRE-RENAL:
Hypoperfusion
RENAL:
Glomerulonephritis
Tubulopathy
Interstitial nephritis
POST-RENAL
Obstruction
</p><p>REMEMBER!
ARF can become CRF (usually due to ATN)</p><p>Clinical features are unreliable.</p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong><br /><br /><p>Cultures: Urinalysis + culture
Bloods: Arterial: acidosis. Venous: hyperkalaemia, raised urea and creatinine, autoantibodies, lipids, liver function etc.
Imaging: CXR, AXR, USS (USS to look at size of kidneys, symmetry, hydronephrosis (dilatation of kidney outflow, suggests post-renal obstruction)
Scopic/Biopsy: Renal biopsy (if undiagnoses)
Functional: ECG (Tented T waves with hyperkalaemia)</p><strong>TREATMENT</strong><br /><br /><p>1. Treat Complications
-Hyperkalaemia (protect myocardium- Calcium gluconate, then remove potassium with dextrose and insulin)
-Pulmonary oedema (diuretics)
-Acidosis (bicarbonate, dialysis if refractory)
2. Treat the underlying cause:
Pre-Renal: fluid resuscitation
Renal: immunosupression, usually in form of steroids to treat eg glomerulonephritis)
Post-Renal: relieve obstruction, nephrostomy

Indications for dialysis:
1. Complications of uraemia: encephalopathy, pericarditis
2. Refractory hyperkalaemia
3. Refractory fluid overload
4. Anuria</p><strong>Chronic Renal Failure</strong><br /><br /><p>""Peristent and  irreversible reduction in renal function""
5 Stages based on GFR:
1. >90ml/min
2. 60-90ml/min
3. 30-60ml/min
4. 15-30ml/min
5. <15ml/min (end stage renal failure)- usually dialysed

CAUSES
ANYTHING! Most comon causes: Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Glomerulonephritis

A MultiSystem Disease:
NERVOUS SYSTEM: Peripheral neuropathy, restless legs syndrome, tiredness and fatigue (due to uraemia)
CARDIOVASCULAR: Fluid overload, ACCELERATED ATHEROGENESIS- vulnerable to heart disease, PVD etc (preventative role of statins?), uraemic pericarditis
GI: Altered taste perception, reduced absorption of calcium (failure of hydroxylation to 25-Vit D)
BONES- Hyperparathyroidism: renal osteodystrophy, bone cysts
ELECTROLYTE/METABOLIC: Electrolyte abnormalities-hyperkalaemia, acidosis. Cramps.
BLOOD: Reduced EPO secretion --> anaemia of chronic disease (normocytic). Impaired platelet function (uraemia)- bruising.</p><strong>Management</strong><br /><br /><p>Conservative:
Education, planning for dialysis, FLUID RESTRICTION, renal diet (avoid high K+/phosphate)

Medical:
TREAT CARDIOVASCULAR RISK REGULARLY
Phosphate binders (renagel); Alfacalcidol to supress PTH; Recombinant EPO; Quinine (cramps); Bicarbonate (acidosis)

Interventional:
RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY</p>",3777,10,46,2012-12-31 15:44:22 UTC,2012-12-31 15:44:22 UTC
Acute Renal Failure,"<strong>Acute Renal Failure</strong><br /><br /><p>up to 5% of hospital inpatients will develop acute renal failure during their stay
Mortality 40-50% from AKI injuries

ARF= ""acute impairment in renal function"", ""acute decline in GFR from baseline""
Often associated w/ creatinine rise and anuria/oliguria
Usually reversible if detected and treated early.

PROBLEMS with AKI
1. Uraemia
2. Failure of fluid balance (fluid overload)
3. Failure of electrolyte regulation (hyperkalaemia)
4. Failure of acid-base regulation (acidosis)

</p><p>Causes:
PRE-RENAL
RENAL
POST-RENAL</p><p>However, sometimes a combination of all of these! (eg post-surgery ARF due to fluid loss, systemic infxn (general vasodilatation), nephrotoxic drugs (eg gent, whcih causes interstitial nephritis).

PRE-RENAL: HYPOPERFUSION
stenosis in renal arteries, loss of circulating volume (most common)
RENAL: Think about structures in the kidney!
Glomerulus: Glomerulonephritis (eg IgA nephropathy)
Tubules: Acute Tubular Necrosis (consequence of prolonged, acute renal failure, which quickly becomes irreversible and as such becomes chronic RF)
Interstitium: Nephritis (DRUGS eg NSAIDS, typically long term use, gentamycin, contrast)
Vessels: Vasculitis, HUS/TTP
POST-RENAL: OBSTRUCTION (leads to back pressure; hydronephrosis; ARF)
Stones
Tumours
Prostate</p><strong>Clinical Features</strong><br /><br /><p>History:
General: fatigue, vomiting, pruritis.
More specific: SOB, PND (as kidneys regulate fluid balance, also pH: acidosis?). Symptoms of uraemia: Confusion, hiccoughs, chest pain
Examination: Full examination.
Assess fluid status (pt may be under or overloaded!)
Feel for bladder (eg in case of post-renal cause, eg BPH)
</p><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong><br /><br /><p>Blood test:
Raised creatinine
Raised urea</p><strong>Management</strong><br /><br /><p>Remember! Problems:
1. Uraemia
2. Failure of fluid balance (fluid overload): Chest X Ray (shows pulmonary oedema), ?ABG
3. Failure of electrolyte regulation (hyperkalaemia): U&Es/ECG (tall tented T waves with +++K+)
4. Failure of acid- base regulation (acidosis): ABG. Could get away with venous blood gas if not worried about the respiratory state of the patient- minimises pt discomfort from repeated ABGs.</p><strong>TREATMENT</strong><br /><br /><p>Treat dangerous things first!! Don't just dive in with fluids.
Monitoring.
Hyperkalaemia:
Give 10mls 10% calcium gluconate to protect the heart by stabilisin myocardium. Then want to think about driving K+ down, so 50ml 20-50% dextrose and insulin. If not resolving, salbutamol nebulisers (which also decreases circulating K+), (calcium resonium, given orally or rectally as enema, need close monitoring of pt)
Pulmonary oedema: Frusemide. Dose 40-80mg. 
Acidosis: Don't give bicarbonate. If severe, must dialyse.</p><strong>Indications for dialysis</strong><br /><br /><p>Refractory hyperkalaemia
Refractory acidosis
Refractory pulmonary oedema
Uraemic encephalopathy
Uraemic pericarditis</p><strong>So, You've treated DANGEROUS things, now TREAT THE UNDERLYING CAUSE</strong><br /><br /><p>Usually this will be RENAL UNDER-PERFUSION
Assess intravascular volume
Give fluids (cautiously, as one feature of advanced renal failure is fluid overload, and if giving large fluid boluses and pt isn't urinating, don't assume they are underfilled-could be that kidneys aren't working, in whicg case you'll push them into pulmonary oedema.)
Stop nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDS, GENTAMYCIN< CONTRAST)

Breast Disease,"<p>Lumps, when appear, when get worse, painful or not, association with menstrual cycle. 
Discharge - any? quantity? purulent? blood?
Assocations - changes in breast, skin change, nipple retraction, metastatin/constituional sympotms e.g. lost weight, bony pain, appetite, tummy pain.
PMH - previous breast problems, full O&G Hx, need to determine oestrogen exposure, certain O&G patterns are associated with an increased risk of breast malignancy. 
FHx - very important, esp BRCA and relatives. 
DH - exogenous oestrogens - OCP, HRT etc. 
Examoinatin - Inspect, Palpation - breast, axila etc
Lumps, peu d'orange - lymphatic spread, skin colour, ulceration through skin surface, eczematous change of nipple - paget's disease, change in position, discharge
if inversion - is it normal?</p><strong>Radiology (2nd part of triple assesment)</strong><br /><br /><p>US - useful <35 yo

Further division into hormonal, infective, inflammatory, benign tumours
</p><p>Congential - Amastia (absence of breast and nipple) aka Polands syndrome; hypoplasia, most women have a degree of this, with one breast being bigger than the other. Accesory nipples - failure of primitive milk line to regress, excision if problematic/painful/cosmetic. </p><p>Acquired - split into subdivision
Hormonal -
Benign mamary dysplasia/ANDI - pre-menopausal, painful, nodular lump(s) in upper outer quadrant, Rx: analgesia, evening primrose oil -- tamoxifen, bromocriptine, excision
ANDI - aberration of normal development and involution - fibrosis, adenosis, cyst formaition, papillomatosis
Wearing a good bra can help
Conservative, medical, surgical - Rx
Cystic disease - Px approaching menopause (40-50s); cysts transilluminate and contain green/brown fluid on aspiration. If persistant/blood - need FNAC +/- US

Fibroadenoma (breast mouse), young women (15-40), 20% discrete mases; smooth, firm, mobile (possibly multiple) masses. 
Can be either pericanicular when they are hard and white or intracanicular where they are large and soft
Often regress, if large (>5cm) or show malignant change they require excision. 
Fibroadenomas - follow menstrual cycle. </p><p>Infective causesL
- lactational mastitis - staph infection when cracked nipples from breast feeding, can form absecess which is a complication which may require surgical drainage. Rx ABs
- non-lactational mastitis - usually bacterial (staph), complication: periductal mastitis - mastalgia, discharge, nipple retraction. Rx analgesia, Abx (fluclox)

- Narrow QRS (uses conduction fibres), can be irregular (so is AF), or regular so can be 1. sinus tachycardia, 2. AVNRT, 3. AVRT
AVNRT - accessory pathway within the AV node, continually produce impulses to ventricle - tachycardia. 
AVRT - second accessory pathway between atrial and ventricles - continued activation of ventricles from atria - problem when goes into AF - fibrillations get passed to Ventricles - VF!
AVRT - WPW, have episodic tachycardias - other features - V1, V3 - shorted PR interval, delta wave - QRS looks like letter delta</p><strong>ST segment and T wave</strong><br /><br /><p>ST elevation: 1. acute MI, 2. pericarditis, 3. high take-off

High take off - looks like ST elevation due baseline is elevation, in fact not classic STElev

ST Depression 
Most important is ischaemia - can happen in exercise, basis for ETT; Diogoxin can cause this - looks like 'reverse tick' sign

T-wave - can be normal or inverted, or peaked, focus on inversion.
AVR and V1 which is normal.

Decide on whether child is green, amber, red depending upon features e.g. colour, activity, respiratory, hydration,other.
if child appears unwell - red. also parent can tell you this is not normal for my child.
Resp - when start to display resp compensation immead amber. 
Other - points towards usual causes e.g. swelling of joint, non-blanching rash, bile stained vomits
In ax - try to establish the source of infection e.g. focal symps and then want to know what is the effect of infec on child. Try to ax severity - how are they compare to normal, eating and drinking, playing, sleeping, wet nappies, opening bowels, are they consolable?
if child is playing then probs ok, wet nappies - measure urine output and dehydration. consolable - if inconsolable may be amber/red category.
KEy is examination
LOOK at the child - do they look well or not?
obs - Temp, HR, RR, Cap refil = dehydration. (resp distress signs)
Top to toe - feel fontanelles, ears and nose and Lymph nodes. Chest (listen) look for nasal flaring, accessory musc use. feel abdo.
UNDRESS the child - look for rash e.g. meningitis.

once assessed and put in box then follow guidelines for management. 
Green - go home, Red = see paed consultant.
Tx - general tx = fluids, keep cool paracetemol, (not antibiotics), educate parents re: symps.

Gastroenteritis and Dehydration in Kids,"<strong>Gastroenteritis and Dehydration</strong><br /><br /><p>Very common!
Definitions - inflammation of stomach and intestine usual due to infective agent. Pt will have sudden onset diarrhoea.
Cause - Viral, bacteria, protazoa.
Viral = Rotavirus (60%), adenovirus.
Bacterial = salmonella, campylobater, e.coli, shigella. Commonly child <2years. 
Both through fecal oral route and bacterail from poorly cooked meat.
Both cause D&V, crampy abdo pain, fever, dehydration and electrolyte disturbance.
Difference is that Viral may give URTI signs and diarrhoea is maore watery. and bacterial gives dysentery = blood/mucus in diarrhoea, malaise + tenesmus.
DD = meningitis, DKA, septicaemia. If in doubt admit and do obs!
Ax = dehydration in paeds as this can quickly lead to shock, death and metabolic acidosis.
Is pt well/unwell, drowsy? (irritable/lethargic) what is the urine output? pale/mottled skin and ?feels cold/peripherally shut down. All signs of dehydration.
Classify dehydration as mild/mod/severe - decide through mucuous membranes, colour, consciousness, urine output, BP, HR, skin turgor. capillary refil and weigh pt. BP only comes decreased in severe dehydration.
Inv = stool cultures (only done in recent travel or >7days diarrhoea or suspect wrong diagnosis, ?septacaemia or if child immunospuressed).
Bloods - FBC, U+E, CRP, Glucose (DKA). If child devs colitis can do sigmoidoscopy.

TX = supportive e.g. ORT, primary prevention, fluids/milk
antibiotics are needed v rarely.
Dehydration Tx - depends on mild/mod/severe.
mild - feeds with ORT, mod - 6hr trial of NG feeds + 100ml/kg, severe - IV fluids 20mil/kg.

Adaptations at Birth,"<strong>Physiological adaptations at birth</strong><br /><br /><strong>Blood flow in fetus</strong><br /><br /><p>High pulmonary vascular resistance blood from R side bypasses lungs. blood flow to lungs is low and not much blood goes to lungs. Bypass is via Patent Ductus arteriosus. Ductus arteriosus connects R ventricular outflow tract to aorta - thus allowing blood to get into the systemic circulation (bypass lungs). Foramen Ovale connects L atria and R atria. Ductus venosus shunts umblical vein to IVC bypassing the liver. After birth these shall all heal and not be present after first few hours of birth. All happens to reduce wasted blood to lungs and increase efficiency of blood to fetus. During labour - infant squeexed and reduce liquid in lungs. increased catecholamines stimulate breathing and breathing stimulates absorption of remaining lung fluid. Umblical cord clamped - venous return to R atrium is reduced, there is a rise in L atrial pressure and increase in pulmonary venous return. Change in pressure closes the foramen ovale and the ductus venosus closes and blood goes through liver. Lung expansion causes increased oxygen levels. lung aeration leads to decreased pulmonary vasc resistance and increased blood flow in lungs. The flow of oxygenated blood leads to ductus arteriosus closing.</p><strong>Factors that increase pulmonary vascular resistance and interfere with adaptation</strong><br /><br /><p>If fetus is unwell / acidotic e.g. metabolic acidosis due to infection. Hypoxia at birth, under inflation of the lung, pulmonary hypoplasia (under dev lungs) and ventricular dysfucntion. Result in increased pulmonary vascular resistance, decreased flow of blood to the lungs and interferes with adaptation.

The Red Eye,"<p>If a patient presents with a suspected corneal ulcer they need urgent referal to opthalmology to ensure that the ulcer is irrigated and that a sample of the tissue is taken for culture and sensitivity
Scleritis is an uncommon but potentially blinding condition.
Anterior Uveitis requires treatment from the opthalmologist as it is difficult to diagnose within the acute setting. Recurrence of the condition is common and therefore follow up is required from opthalmology.
Subconjunctival Haemorrhage does not need referal to opthalmology as it is self limiting and does not require further investigation.
Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma is a sight threatening condition which requires urgent referal to opthalmology.</p><p>Foreign Body Sensation is not a feature of Anterior Uveitis as the inflammation is within the uveal tract (iris, ciliary body and choroid)

Photophobia, decreased visual acuity, red eye, posterior synechiae are all symptoms of inflammation within the uveal tract.

Posterior Synechiae is cause by inflammation resulting in the iris sticking to the cornea creating an irregular pupil. </p><p>The key to this management is time!!! The longer the burn the more damage that can be done. Alkali burns are worse than acid burns but should both be managed in the same way thoroughly washing out the eye before asking questions. </p><p>Patients with hypermetropia are more prone to acute closure glaucoma as they have smaller eyes. Having smaller eyes mean that they have smaller angles between their cornea and iris.

Esotropia is a convergent squint.
Myotopia, emmetropia & presbeopia are not prone to ACCG</p><p>Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma can often present to A&E with systemic symptoms (e.g. headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and a red eye)
and often the red eye is missed. This can result in an opthalmological emergency or worse loss of sight for the patient in this eye.

The keratitis, scleritis and anterior uveitis can present with sufficient pain but not systemic enough to result in nausea and vomiting.

Conjunctivitis is an infection of the epithelium on the conjunctivia and is not likely to cause systemic upset.</p><p>Anterior Uveitis is iodiopathic in 50% of cases however is also linked to HLA-B27 conditions such as IBD, Anklosing Spondilitis, Reiters Syndrome.</p>",2981,14,,2012-12-31 15:43:16 UTC,2012-12-31 19:16:08 UTC

Back Pain,"<strong>Cauda Equina</strong><br /><br /><strong>Spinal Fractures</strong><br /><br /><p>Wedge fractures: the anterior portion of the vertebra breaks and loses height, however the posterior part of it does not. These are usually stable fractures and rarely associated with neurological problems.

Fracture-dislocations: unstable involving bone and/or soft tissue, whereby a vertebra may be displaced adjacently off another. They frequently cause serious spinal cord compression.

Axial burst fracture: the vertebra loses height both anteriorly and posteriorly. These are often caused by falling from a height and landing on the feet.

Distraction or Chance fractures: the vertebra is literally pulled apart. This occurs in accidents such as a head-on car crash, in which the upper body is thrown forward while the pelvis is stabilised by a lap seat belt.

Transverse process fractures: uncommon and result from rotation or extreme lateral bending. They do not usually affect stability.</p><p>- Can be due to tumour, fracture or disc herniation.
- Can present with bilateral sciatica, saddle anaesthesia and leg weakness in addition to urinary retention and faecal incontinence.
- If compression left long enough, urinary retention may become irreversible.

S2-S4 involvement causes:
1. detrusor muscle contraction, 
2. external bladder sphincter relaxation and 
3. anal sphincter contraction.

2. UMN below level of lesion

- emergengy that requires surgical decompression</p><strong>Lower Back Pain With Radiation</strong><br /><br /><p>Neurogenic claudication is often seen in spinal stenosis, which can be caused by congenital and most commonly acquired (degenerative/traumatic/infective) pathology. It involves pain brought on by exertion that is relieved by changing position (i.e. sitting or leaning forward). Causes of spinal stenosis include spondylolisthesis, osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc prolapse and pagetâs disease.

Intermittent claudication is pain classically affecting the calf muscles which is brought on by exercise and relieved by rest. It is caused by arterial insufficiency from atherosclerotic blockages of vessels in peripheral vascular disease.

Sciatica usually affects one leg. It involves pain (and occasionally numbness, tingling and muscle weakness) which may be felt in the buttock, down the back of the leg, below the knee and in the foot.

Postherpetic neuralgia is a chronic pain disorder resulting from reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (shingles).

Fibromyalgia is characterised by chronic widespread pain and allodynia (a heightened and painful response to pressure).</p><p>Spondylolisthesis is where one vertebrae slips forward relative to the one above. L5 is most commonly involved. Diagnosis can be made from a lateral plane spine x-ray.

Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the spine and sacroiliac joint, commonly affecting young males aged 20-40 years old. It often presents with chronic pain and stiffness in the mid-spine, often with pain referred to the buttocks or back of the thigh from the sacroiliac joints.

Mechanical back pain tends to affect the lower back and is worse on movement and relieved by rest. Loss of the normal lumbar lordosis may be seen due to muscle spasm and there may be tenderness on palpation of paraspinal muscles.

Cauda equina syndrome may present with saddle anaesthesia, urinary retention, faecal incontinence and leg weakness. It is regarded as an emergency and usually requires urgent surgical decompression.

A prolapsed intervertebral disc can occur from bending, lifting, twisting, coughing or sneezing. It causes pain in the lower back over the affected region, along with possible pain, numbness and tingling along the distribution of the affected sciatic nerve. These patients will often have a positive straight leg raise test.</p>",2981,17,76,2012-12-31 15:43:16 UTC,2012-12-31 15:43:16 UTC

Heart Murmurs,"<p>Murmurs are caused by turbulent blood flow. This can be caused by valvular disease or a patent ductus arteriosus or a septal defect.
Key to murmurs is the timing and the site
a murmur occurring just after S1 is a systolic murmur, often this murmur will cause the S2 to be masked or sound quiet by comparison. Example - aortic stenosis
a murmur occurring just after S2 is an early diastolic murmur - aortic regurg
a murmur occurring between S2 and S1 is a mid diastolic murmur - mitral stenosis
Aortic valve - auscultated at the 2nd right intercostal space
Pulmonary - 2nd left intercostal
tricuspid - 5th left intercostal
mitral - apex
Radiating murmurs
carotids - ask patient to hold breath slightly and ascultate. listen for bruits on both sides - aortic stenosis
mitral stenosis radiates to the axilla, ask patient to lean to their left side as this accentuates the murmur
aortic regurg. -ask the patient to sit up, ausculate at the tricuspid area, best heard on expiration
Systolic murmurs - aortic stenosis and mitral regurg
aortic stenosis - ejection systolic murmur - occurs just after S1, S1 clearly heard before
mitral regurg - pansystolic murmur, difficult to hear the heard sounds
Diastolic murmurs - aortic regurg and mitral stenosis
aortic regurg - early diastolic
mitral stenosis - mid diastolic, use the bell

Heart Sounds,"<p>S1 - signals beginning of systole, the sound of the tricuspid and mitral valves closing, during diastole blood flows from the atria to the venticles, the closure occurs because the pressure in the ventricles is greater than the atria forcing the valves shut.
S2 - signals the beginning of diastole, the sound of the aortic and pulmonary valves closing, during systole the blood is flowing out of the ventricles therefore the pressure in the vessels is decreases, you get a little backflow of blood triggering the closure of these valves. 
diastole is usually longer than systole helping to differentiate between the 2 sounds. not allows a reliable method - palpate the carotid pulse, heart sound at pulse is the first heart sound
physiological splitting of the second heart sound - occurs on inspiration, during inspiration the thoracic cavity pressure decreases causing increased flow of blood to the lungs. this increases the blood in the left ventricle causing the aortic valve to close just before the pulmonary
S3 - just after S2, can be physiological in children and adults under 40 due to rapid ventricular filling. Always pathology in those over 40 - patent ductus arteriosus, septal defect, CAD, along with gallop rhythm in heart failure
S4 - always pathological, occurs just before S1, can be heard along with a gallop rhythm in heart failure, CAD, hypertension, aortic and pulmonary stenosis.

Anaesthetic Drugs,"<strong>Anaesthetic Drugs</strong><br /><br /><p>Induction:
Preoxygenate patient
Propofol: non-barbituate agent that gives a smooth and rapid induction. Often used with fentanyl for extra sedation. Propofol side effect: smooth muscle relaxant so reduces central venous tone and reduces cardiac output. Monitor BP. Metabolised by the liver, as well as fat tissues. Propofol stings so inject lidocaine as well.
Thiopentone: rapid sequence inductions, short acting barbituate, broken down and redistributed into tissues. Causes post op nausea and somnelence, now not often used. Sevoflurane (vapour) commonly used in paediatrics.

Muscle Paralysis: Impulse arrives at NMJ, ACh release, binds to nicotinic receptors on post synaptic membrane. Ion channel, causes the influx of sodium. and depolarisation of the cell.
Depolarising: Suxamethonium- used in rapid sequence induction. works within 30 seconds and is cleared within 7 mins. Binds to post synaptic receptor, causes depolarisation, but does not get broken down by ACh esterase. It stays in the system until broken down by pseudocholinesterase.
Non-depolarising: competitive binding to ACh receptors: Vecuronium, Rocuronium, Atracurium (causes brochospasm).

Maintenance of anaesthesia: Gases: desflurance, isoflurane, sevoflurane. Or can set up a propofol infusion.
</p><p>Gases: which one? Desflurane: is irritant to resp system- not for smokers/ asthmatic. Isoflurane- takes a while to wake patients. Sevoflurane: very expensive. ""MAC"" Minimum alveolar concentration- minimum concentration of vapour in the lungs to keep 50% of men anaethetised and not responsive to painful stimulus. Should try to keep mac of patient about 1.
Propofol can be monitored by EEG monitioring. (BIS)

Emergency: 
Anti-chollinergics: if pt has dropped HR but maintains BP give atropine.
Dropped BP but normal HR: give alpha agonists as peripheral vasoconstrictors: e,g. phenylephrine/ metaraminol.
If dropped BP and HR: alpha and beta agonist: Ephedrine
If HR or BP increases: Opiate or Labetolol

Reversal of muscle relaxants: neostigmine: AChesterase inhibitor increase ACh at nerve terminals and displace the muscle relaxant. Glycopyralate is also given to combat bradycardia.

Post-Op: give anti-emetic 10 mins before waking. Cyclizine and ondansetron, prescribe as operation has ended and PRN.
Dexamethasone (pre-op anti emetic)
Analgesia: Opiates pre-op e.g fentanyl. Intraop: morphine. Post op: PRN paracetamol or PCA.</p>",2232,30,118,2012-12-31 15:42:31 UTC,2012-12-31 15:42:31 UTC
Fracture Management,"<strong>Fracture Management</strong><br /><br /><p>Heterotrophic bones can develop after repeated trauma e.g. horse rider's thighs.
Fracture: Partial or complete disruption of the cortex of a bone.
Dislocation: Complete disruption of a joint. Subluxation: partial disruption of a joint.
Injury is not limited to the bone.
Fatigue fracture: fracture due to repeated trauma to normal bone.
Fracture X-ray:
Background: PAtient details, film details (plain radiograph and view)- ask if there are previous films.
Desription:
Simple: 2 pieces, Comminuted >2 pieces.
Open: when skin is breached.
Type: Transverse, oblique, spiral, impacted, hairline, greenstick/buckle
Location: metaphyseal, diaphyseal, epiphyseal or articular.

Displacement:
Describes the distal with respect to the proximal bit of bone.
If displaced, this is described as translation. medial, lateral, anterior or posterior.

Angulation

Shortening in cms
Rotation

Comment on soft tissues:
Elbow: posterior fat pad= pathological and it is 90% likely to demonstrate an intra-articular fracture.
Knee: lipo haemathrosis

This is a radiograph of Mr Bloggs, aged 28. It is an AP view of his Left lower leg.
There are fractures to the tibia and fibula.
Tibia fracture: simple fracture in the mid diaphysis. There is translation of 50% and no apparent angulation or rotation.
The fibula fracture is a comminuted fracture of the mid diaphysis with 3 segments. there is 50% lateral translation of the medial segment with no obvious angulation, shortening or rotation.

Salter harris:
Involving the epiphyseal plate. Prognostic value.
Slipped: the fracture line runs through the plate
Above: the fracture line runs above the epiphysis, usually with a triangular fragment. 
Lower: fracture line runs below the plate so the fracture is part of the epiphysis
Through: through the epiphyseal plate
Rammed: the epiphysis is crushed.</p>",2232,17,77,2012-12-31 15:42:31 UTC,2012-12-31 15:42:31 UTC

Bleeding Disorders,"<strong>Haemostasis</strong><br /><br /><p>- Haemostasis= normal physiological process:
1) Vasoconstriction
2) Platelet adhesion to exposed collagen forming a temporary 'loose platelet plug'
3) Stabilisation: Fibrin rich scaffold driven by tissue factor and thrombin generation
4) Self-limitation: tPA responsible for activating plasminogen from plasmin, breaks down fibrin into fibrin degradation products. Also anti-thrombin III, protein C, protein S.

Cascade: Common pathway leads to formation of insoluble fibrin that stabilises the platelet plug. Factor X and Factor V, along with calcium and phospholipids calls for prothrombin (II) to be converted into factor (IIa).

Intrinsic pathway: Uniquely possess factors IX and VIII- these are deficient in haemophilia A and B.

Extrinsic pathways: Tissue factor (activated with the subendothelial matrix is exposed), and Factor VII.

Investigations:
1. FBC: platelets, anaemia, leucopenia.
2. Coagulation screen:
PT (INR) extrinsic and common pathways
APTT: exclusively at the intrinsic pathway (therefore raised in haemophilia factor VIII and IX deficiencies)
TT: Thrombin time. Increased if there is a reduced fibrinogen level (in DIC) also if on heparin.

FVIII and vWF assay- as vWF disease has no effects on the above tests.
</p><strong>Bleeding disorders</strong><br /><br /><p>Haemorrhage vs thrombosis.

Haemorrhage: Disorders of platelets:

Normally 150-400 x 10^9/L
Most patients are asymotomatic until the count drops to <50 petechiae, echymoses (bruises)
<20: spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeds, haematemesis.
Causes:
-Increased platelet consumption (thrombocytopenia)
-Decreased platelet function
Acquired: aspirin, uraemia
Inherited: Glycoprotein 1B deficiency</p><p>Increased platelets consumption/ Decreased production from the bone marrow (in which case he platelet number decreases along with other cell lines e.g. leukopenia).

Increased consumption of platelets:
1) Immune thrombocytopenia Purpura: autoantibodies form to the plateletes and results in increased removal of the platelets by the spleen.
a) Acute ITP: prodromal viral infection eg URTI, sudden onset of ITP
b) Chronic ITP: Elderly population, no preceding illness, insidious onset occurs over years. Requires steroids or in severe cases; splenectomy.
c) Immune thrombocytopenia caused by drugs: Penicillin, glycosides, oral hypoglycaemics, heparin, transfusion.
d) SLE
e) Latent HIV- exclude these before consdering ITP.

Non-immune:
1) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,
2) HUS
3) DIC

Disorders of coagulation
Inherited vs Acquired
- Haemarthrosis, delayed bleeeding after trauma.

Inherited:
1) Haemophilia A (congenital deficiency of factor 8)
2) Haemophilia B (deficiency of factor 9)

X-linked recessive disorder, A is more common than B. 
Presentation: identical (as 8 and 9 form complex) severity depends on the level of factor deficiency. Very low levels= spontaneous bleeds, causing haemarthroses. Prolonged APTT as factor 8 and 9 are part of the intrinsic pathway, but a normal PT.
Management: lifelong replacement with freeze dried factors.

von Willebrand Factor disease:
1) Partial loss of vMF produced (Type I deficiency) in adults.
2) Loss of functional vWF (type II disease)
3) Total loss (rare form, type III) often with associated factor 8 deficiency
vWF is important in facilitating the binding of the haemostatic plug to subendothelial extracellular matrix. Also for the stabilisation of factor 8. Most vWF disease will present similiarly to platelet disorders e.g. with petichiae and mucocutaneous bleeding. Severe forms, factor 8 affected therefore a clotting type presentation. Bloods may be normal. Or there may be a prolonged PT and APTT.
Treatment: Desmopression (increases the secretion of vWF by 10x) in partial.

Acquired disorders of clotting:
1) Vit K deficiency: required for carboxylation of factors 2, 7, 9 and 10. Extrinsic and intrinsic factors (raised PT and APTT). Causes: malnutrition and warfarin. Rx = vit K
2) Liver disease: reduced production of factors AND causes POOLING of platelets in an enlarged spleen secondary to portal hypertension.
3) DIC: due to underlying disorder e.g. disseminated gram negative sepsis, trauma, mismatched blood transfusion. Causing widespread endothelial damage, intravascular deposition of fibrin and depletion of platelets and coagulation factors. Elevated PT and APTT. Excess production of fibrin degradation products.

</p><p>Often raised D-dimer Treatment is pletelets, heparin. Aim to buy time to treat underlying disorder.

Thrombotic disorders:
VTE: due to stasis.
Causes of VTE: Inherited= thrombophilias
These patients have recurrent DVTs, clots in unusual sites such as axillary vein, cerebral vein. Most are asymptomatic. NB combined with pregnancy, COCP- more likely to develop clots.

Procoagulant mutations:
1) Factor V leiden (10%) point mutation in factor 5 normal clotting but abnormal inhibition of the procoagulant factors.
2) Prothrombin mutation (elevated levels of prothrombin)
3) Antiphospholipid syndrome- triad of recurrent DVT/PE, strokes, miscarriage. primary (genetic inheritance) more common in women and can cause recurrent miscarriages before 20 weeks anti-cardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant antibodies bind to membrane phospholipids causing a hypercoagulable state. Increase activation of thrombin and inhibit protein C anticoagulation. The APTT is prolonged due to lupus anticoagulant so need to do an 80:20 admixture test.
3) Deficiencies of Protein C and protein S.

Acquired thrombotic disorders:
1) Immobility= stasis and local accumulation of clotting factors.
2) Tissue trauma= in surgery increased output of fibrinogen and platelets. Highest with hip surgery.
3) Malignancy- may have malignant molecule that increases likelihood to clot. Adenocarcinoma.
4) Hyper-oestrogenic state: e.g COCP increases pro-coagulant factors by the liver.
5) Heparin- Induced thrombocytopenia (hypercoagulable state) leads to release of antibodies that bind to platelets and activate them.

Anti-coagulant therapy: provided for isolated calf DVT 35% will have extension of their DVT if left untreated.
Heparin: immediate antithrombotic effect by potentiating the effect of anti-thrombin III.
Safe in pregnancy. a) unfractionated heparin IV bolus then maintenance infusion 2) low molecular weight heparin given od subcutaneously. Monitoring: APTT (1.5-2.5) lmw heparin- monitoring is not usually required as it is v. predictable. If needed- do a factor Xa assay. Heparin's effects can be reversed with protamine.

Warfarin: Long term anticoagulant- vit K antagonist, takes days to start. Monitoring is essential. PT (INR) monitoring. INR 2-3, valve replacement 3-4.</p>",2232,7,33,2012-12-31 15:42:31 UTC,2012-12-31 15:42:31 UTC

starts in yolk sac
start dividing and processing mitosis
they become primary oocytes, done by process of meiosis
you start with diploid and end up with haploid
in fertilization you need haploid since the male gametes also have 23 chromosomes
you begin meiosis in fetus, you start meiosis I when you ovulate years after and meiosis II happens in fertilization
extra chromosomes become polar bodies
Hormonal Changes

Before puberty the levels of gonadotrophins remain low
Near puberty GnRH is increasingly released from the hypothal
GnRH is released in pulses each at 90 minute intervals
increases in amplitude(not frequency)
Causes release of FSH and LH from anterior pituitary
it has to be pulsatile to work properly
Phases of the Menstrual Cycle

Diagram
LH and FSH act on the ovaries which cause the development of oocytes and oestrogen secretion
Elevated secretion of hormones at certain times, causing the egg to be released
FSH stimulates primary oocytes[ leads to eventual development of the graffian follicles(matures the egg) and Increases LH receptors ]
LH acts on the thecal cells of ovary [ androgen produced ]
Important diagram

3 Perspectives (hormone, ovarian histology, endometrial histology)
Day 1 of Menstrual Cycle (usually lasts 4 days)
Day 1 to 8 - follicular phase ( levels of oestrogen are low and basically you get increase in LH and FSH)
FSH stimulating the growth of primary oocytes
Lots of eggs develop
LH starts increasing the levels of oestrogen
Proliferative phase, endometrium is regenerating and getting thicker
Estradiol is going to negatively feedback on the hypothal to decrease FSH and LH
You get such a rise in oestrogen, causes acute positively feedback on LH and FSH, massive LH surge and much smaller surge in FH and obviously after this you get the ovulation
Ovulation definitely occurs after LH surge
Days 14 to 29
you had your surge of LH and FSH, follicle degenerates and becomes the corpus luteum, entering the luteal phase.
The luteal phase is always fixed
The follicular phase is the variable phase
Follicle Development

Recruitment of primary oocytes
Dominant follicle, grows between 9 and 14 days
large collections of fluid between the granulosa cells
graffian becomes....
if there is no fertilization this becomes the corpus luteum
cells become larger in size, lipid droplet accumulation, SER
The end of menstrual cycle

If no fertilisation Corpus Luteum has fully degenerated causing a dropn in the levels of progesterone and oestrogen Results in the endometrial shedding
How do we prevent endometrial shedding? Corpus luteum....

Uterus and Uterine Tubes

Endometrium is made up of two layers(basal and superficial)
Superficial(spiral arterioles)
Basal(straight arterioles)
Basal layer does not take part in mentstruation
superficial layer is dominated by all the changes
Important slides

In proliferative stage, you get increase in endometrial thickness
increase in progesterone
progesterone increases the gland size
progesterone making the endometrium habitable for the trophoblast
spiral arteries contract, and there is necrosis and increase in prostaglandin levels(that can cause pain)
How is the menstrual cycle altered in disease

Damage to the ovary
disruption in hormone levels
actual endometrium, if that layer is compromised and can't regenerate then there will be problems

</p><strong>S1--> closure of AV valves ( Tri and Bicuspid)</strong><br /><br /><strong>S2--> closure of the Semilunlar ( aortic and pulmonary)</strong><br /><br /><p>Murmurs are caused by turbulant flow

S1 marks the approximate beginning of systole- where pressure of ventricular contraction exceeds pressure in the atrium causing the AV valves to close 

The ventricle continue to contract throughout systole forcing blood through the aortic and pulmonary valves.
At the end of systole the ventricles begin to relax---> decrease in pressure
Brief back flow of blood through aortic and pulmonary valves causing them to snap shut


Diastole takes twice as long as systole, there is a longer pause between S2 and S1

heart sound on palpating the pulse is S1

A split heart sound is because a heart sound is the result of two valves closing. 
The Bicuspid valve closure slightly preceeds the closure of the tricuspid, by a matter of milliseconds.

S1 is split on insipration, poor blood to the right side,  so delayed pulmonary valve closure

Schizophrenia,"<p>= lack of contact with reality together with psychotic symptoms

epidemiology - lifetime risk 1%, usually between 15-35yrs (but later in women)

rule of 20s: 20% present acutely and expect full recovery, 20% suffer recurrent acute episodes, 20% chronic illness that starts as an acute illness, 20% chronic illness that starts insidiously, 10-15% commit suicide

favourable prognostic factors:
- acute onset
- high social class
- female
- high IQ

aetiology - multifactorial (genes and environment)
genetics - sibling scz - 10-15% chance of developing, parent scz - 40% chance

risk factors 
- complications in pregnancy
- low social class
- cannabis use
- multiple adverse life events
- temporal lobe pathology

2 common presentations:
- acute syndrome - predominantly positive symptoms
- chronic syndrome - predominantly negative symptoms (triad of lack of drive, social withdrawal, impaired living skills), catatonic symptoms (stupor, excitement)

- increased age has increased incidence of paranoia and reduced behavioural symptoms
- more severe in women and those with high emotional expression

Diagnosis
- passivity phenomenon
- thought possession (control, insertion, withdrawal, broadcasting)
- delusional perception
- hallucinations

- impaired social/occupational function
- symptoms should have existed for a minimum duration - DSM IV: 6 months, ICD-10: 1 month

- exclude organic disorders, drugs, psychotic mood disorders

- if affective components = schizoaffective disorder
- isolated delusions may not indicate schizophrenia, may indicate delusional disorder

Treatment
- exclude other disorders
- assess need for admission
- benzodiazepines
- anti-psychotics (some immediate behavioural action, may take 3 weeks for anti-psychotic action to kick in) - should be used for minimum of 6 months. SEs: tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, hyperglycaemia
- ECT if either 1 severe depressive symptoms or 2 catatonic/stupor
- psychological therapy - family therapy to avoid high EE, CBT to reduce preoccupations if there are drug-resistant hallucinations or delusions

- ipsilateral CN palsy with contralateral motor and/or sensory deficit
- bilateral motor and/or sensory deficit
- disorder of conjugate eye movement
- cerebellar dysfunction without ipsilateral long tract deficits
- or isolated homonymous visual field defect

LACI (lacunar)
- pure motor, more than 2 out of 3 of face, arm, leg
- pure sensory, more than 2 out of 3 of face, arm, leg
- pure sensorimotor, more than 2 out of 3 of face, arm, leg
- ataxic hemiparesis
- no higher dysphasia or visuospatial or hemianopia or vertebrobasilar problems

TACI (total anterior)
- combination of new higher cerebral dysfunction (eg dysphasia)
- homonymous visual field defect and 
- ipsilateral motor and/or sensory deficit of at least two out of three of face, arm and leg

PACI (partial anterior)
- two of the three components of the TACI syndrome with higher cerebral dysfunction alone
- or with a motor/sensory deficit more restricted than those classified as LACI</p>",1556,12,52,2012-12-31 15:41:46 UTC,2012-12-31 15:41:46 UTC

Introduction to Clinical Examination,"<p>1) be systematic</p><strong>Some useful pointers</strong><br /><br /><strong>A to E assessment</strong><br /><br /><p>It is a rapid screening assessment that allows you to find live threatening problems that you should treat as you find them. Each letter stands for a particular system and they are displayed in order of importance and any problems find in any particular system should be addressed before moving to the next one.</p><p>2) develop your own system</p><p>3) be consistent (use the same approach every time)</p><p>4) look out for your own safety and of your colleagues (eg. minimize any time you spent alone with patients and when you do make sure you tell someone where you are and what you are doing; being accompanied by chaperone)</p><p>A - airway</p><p>B - breathing (eg. respiratory distress (respiratory rate, accessory muscle use) -> put the patient on high flow oxygen (15 l/min); oxygenation (colour, O2 sats, arterial blood gas (= gold standard of assessing the oxygenation and also for ventilation); ventilation (chest movement, auscultation))</p><p>C - circulation (pulse, blood pressure; assess endorgan perfusion: peripheral perfusion (temperature), capillary refill time (<2 sec.), force of radial pulse (rarely strong present if SBP is <90mmHg); Two further endorgan functions to assess the cardiac output: brain (reduced gcs) and kidneys (oligo- or anuria))</p><p>D - Disability (""assess someone's consciousness""; gold-standard to assess the consciousness; for a quicker assessment use the AVPU-Scale - here you grade someone as either: 1) being alert, 2) responding to voice, 3) responding to pain (responding to a GCS of <8), 4) unresponsive; ask for a blood glucose (as abberations could cause decreased consciousness)        </p><p>E - exposure, environment (external signs of life-threatening injuries, rashes, swellings, temperature) </p><strong>One example of a scheme you can follow</strong><br /><br /><p>Nails -> Hands (deformity, temperature) -> Arms (blood pressure) -> Neck (JVP, Carotid pulse) -> Face (shape, colour) -> Eyes (in and around the eyes) -> Mouth (in and around the mouth) -> Anterior neck/ adenopathy (palpate for nodes (cervical, submandibular, submental, supraclavicular, axilla), goitre, trachea) -> Anterior thorax (inspecting, palpating, percussing and auscultating) -> Posterior thorax -> Abdomen -> Lumbar area and flanks -> External genital regions -> Legs (petechiae, vascular disease) -> Feet</p><p>Using the system in this way is helpful because should you get lost during your exam it is easy to use the patients own body as an aide-memoire and tells you which region of the body you should go on to examine next</p><strong>Think of things that would complete your examination</strong><br /><br /><p>Cultures, bloods, imaging, scopic/ biopsy, functional (ecg, spirometry, exercise tolerance test)</p><p>another mnemonic: ""UBEX Special"" (Urine, bloods, ECG, X-ray, Special tests) </p><strong>Presentation of your findings</strong><br /><br /><p>the key is: make it distinct (klar, deutlich) and also catch and maintain the attention of the listener </p><p>to do this you can provide a hook (AufhÃ¤nger), which is a lead-in with a few statements about the patient and who they are and something interesting about them (eg. ""this 76 year old never smoker"" or ""this 90-year old nursing resident""</p><p>(as with everything it is good to) be systematic</p><p>but you should decide early on what the most likely diagnosis is and present your findings clustering differnt signs to support that diagnosis - you should also refute (widerlegen) any potential differential diagnosis -> this is what makes a good presentation, instead of a long list of positive and negative signs, you can group them together and this helps to make a more cohesive story and helps maintain the attention of the listener and is easy for you to remember</p><p>decide what the most likely diagnosis is - emphasize your positive findings - Avoid too much details - offer your diagnosis and differential - go on to suggest Ix (investigations) and Mx (therapy)</p><p>WEITER 23:00 - nur mehr PrÃ¤sentationsbeispiel!!!! dann fertig!!!</p>",1377,1,1,2012-12-31 15:41:30 UTC,2012-12-31 15:41:30 UTC

Menstrual Cycle,"<p>Adrenarche - growing hair
thelarche - growing of long bones
oogonia = eggs
born with absolute number of oogonia

Hormonal changes n puberty
- gonadotrophins (FSH and LH) low until just before puberty (gonadotrophin releasing hormone released from hypothalamus in pulses at 90 min intervals).  This stimulates FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary.

Phases of the menstrual cycle.
- FSH stimulates primary oocytes, matures the eggs, increases LH receptors
- LH acts on the thecal cells of the ovary. Stimulates the production of androgens (which can be converted into oestrogens)

Menstrual Cycle
- initially menstruation (day 1)
- follicular phase (day 1-8) levels of oestrogen are low, increase in LH and FSH.  Gradual rise in oestrogens. 
- Thickness of endometrium is directly related to oestrogen levels.
LH and FSH cause increased oestrogen.
- As oestrogen levels rise, this negatively feedbacks on LH and FSH levels
- Then oestrogen gets so high that it causes an LH and FSH surge.  
- LH surge stimulates ovulation (day 14)
- Post ovulation the follicle begins to degenerate and becomes the corpus luteum (the luteal phase - always fixed in length)

The end of cycle
- If no fertilisation - corpus luteum degenerates causing a fall in oestrogen and progesterone levels.  Results in endometrial shedding.

- If fertlisation occurs - corpus luteum is maintained by the developing trophoblast (foetus)

Endometrium then myometrium then perimetrium

Endometrium made of 2 layers:
1. Superficial layer - contains spiral arterioles, undergoes many changes in cycle.
2. basal layer - contains straight arterioles, does not take part in menstruation, does not change

Increase in oestrogen causes growth of superficial endometrium
At day 14, increase in progesterone causes an increase in the secretion from the glands in the endometirum, increases gland size.  

During menstruation - spiral arteries contract and there is necrosis of the superficial layer, shedding, increase in prostaglandin levels, causes contraction of uterus.

Systolic- aortic stenosis, ejection systolic, mitral regurg- pan-systolic
Diastolic- aortic regurg, mitral stenosis low frequency, preceding click (mid-diastolic)

Machinary-PDA
Loudness- grading 1-6, 3=median intensity,loudness does not correlate to severity

Pleural Effusions,"<p>PLEURAL EFFUSION

pleura- visceral and parietal
abnormal fluid accumulation in the pleura
Starts at the apex, meet at the 2nd rib, at 6th costal cartilage both right and left pleural going laterally, in the mid line 8th, mid-axiallry- 10th, posteriorly 12th.
2, 4, 6, 8, 

CAUSES:
TRANSUDATES VS EXUDATES
Starlings- exudate-permeability of the vasculature has been altered; causing water to move out; protein leak.
Transudates- oncotic pressure.

Transudates:
-LVF (changes in pressure)
-Liver cirrhosis (hypoalbuminaemia)
-nephrotic syndrome-
-peritoneal dialysis

Exudates
-malignancy
-parapneumonic effusions (associated with pneumonia)
-tuberculosis
-P.E
-Pancreastisis

What's the difference between an abcess and empyema?
=abcess- collection of pus in an unnatural body cavity 
=empyema- pus in an already defined cavity

Clinical features
- presence of an effusion, cause of this effusion
inspection- decreased chest expansion on side of effusion, evidence of previous scars,
palpation- tracheal deviation- away from pleural effusion in large pleural effusions, tactile vocal fremetus- low frequency vibrations- large pleural effusions get decreased transmission of sounds; increased in consolidation;
Percussion- listen and feel for resonance; dullness to percussion (stony dull) differential- consolidation
Auscultation- absent breath sounds over pleural effusion; decrease vocal resonance; crackles due to pressure of effusion; pleural rub

Consolidation vs effusion
- in consolidation increase in tactile vocal femitus; percussion note dull in consolidation more so in effusion; trachea will always be central in consolidation.

History and physical examination important- always ask about occupational history.

Important investifations
-chest x-ray- meniscus

Atypical symptoms-
cough without wheeze, voice disturbance, lack of airways obstruction
On examination, other than wheeze suggestive of other disease
Conditions- COPD, heart failure, bronciectasis, GORD, pulmonary fibrosis, large airway obstruction

3 goals- control symptoms, prevent exacerbation, reduced airway remodelling

Mild- inhaled B2 agonist (increase sympathetic output)
step 2- regular preventive therapy
step 3- long action B2 agonist

Renal Medicine in 50 minutes,"<p>Renal medicine:
Think anatomically- regulation of fluid balance, homestasis:

Pre-renal-
Blood flow and blood vessels
Hypoperfusion- insufficient blood supply to kineys; not enough urine produced to perform key function of the kidney. usually reversible. May led to acute tubular necrosis (irrevisble)
Blood vessels- hypertention- thickening of vessel walls particularly small musuclar arteries and aterioles- luminal narrowing- chronic ischaemia- gradual loss of nephrons
Atherosclerotic renal disease- renal artery stenosis- typical patient arteripath- aude to ischaemic nephropathy (hypoperfusion); secondary hypertension (RAA mediated).

Renal- glomerulus, tubules, interstitum
Glomerulus- knot of capillaries (tuft) projecting into Bowman's capsule- supported by connective tissue (mesangium)

Glomerulonephritis
injury+inflam of glomeruli
Primary- idiopathic; secondary- another disease process.
Ultra filtration ---damage---leakage of proteins and blood=nephotic syndrome

Associated with (secondary causes):
lupus
DM
amyloidosis
infections
vasculitis

Sub-types:
1. Membranous glomerulonephritis: in adults- nephrotic
2. focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
3. minimal change disease- child with nephrotic sundrome
4. IgA nephropathy (berger's) young males recurring haematuria
5. Post-streptococal glomerulonephritis- post- infection, children, young adults

Tubular disease:
Acute tubular necrosis- shock acute renal failue, not corrected properly.
occurs due to ISCHAEMIS; others gentamicine and contrast median, myoglobin, haemaglobin (malaria).
Pre-renal can cause renal failue.
Other tubular disorders:
Excessive loss of substances or inadequate excretion of substances

Intersititial disease- intersititial nephritis
Acute
Type 1 hypersensitivty response- immediate degranulation of mast cells releasing IgE- eg antibiotics (penicillin) -NSAIDS -Diuretics
Pyelonephritis- acute ascending infection- unwell patient- loin pain and dysuria -renal failue.

Chronic/reflux nephropathy
-vesicoureteric reflux; unilateral--hypertension; bilateral--- CRF

Post renal
Stones
Malignancy
Prostatic hypertrophy
Chronic urinary retention
Inflammation (retro-peritoneal fibrosis)
Post-renal


PRESENTATIONS
non-specific- malaise, fatigue, urinary symptoms

NEPHROTIC SYNDROMES
1. proteinuria
2. hypoalbuminaemia
3. oedema

(albumin is the key blood protein- lose protein, albummin will fall.)
Loss of albumin means build up of fluid-oedema.
Along side a hyperlipidaemia, reduced immunity and hypercoagulability.
Manifestion of glomerulus disease.....
Peri-orbital oedema 1st, plus peripheral oedema- can lead to ascites and pleural effusions.
Causes:
-diabetic nephropathy
children- minimal change disease- responses well to steroids.

NEPHRITIC SYNDROME
1. Proteinuria (less than nephrotic)
2. haematuria
3. Fluid overload (acute onsent
Brown urine
Adults- IgA nephropathy- bergers
Children- post-streptococal infection

RENAL FAILURE
ACUTE-rapid loss of glomerular function
- Rise of creatinine
Problems. 1. Uraemia 2. failure of fluid balance (fluid overload) 3. Failure of electrolyte regulation (hyperkalaemia) 4. Failure of acid-base regulation (acidosis)

Cultures - urinalysis+culture
Bloods- aterial- acidosis; venous- U+Es- looking for hyperkalaemia. establishing cause- autoantibiodies, lipids, LFTS
Imaging- CxR, AxR, USS 
Scopic- renal biopsy if undiagnosed
Functional- ECG (tented t waves)

Treatment
Treat complications- hyperkalemia- protect myocardium -remove potassium
pulmonary oedema- diuretics
Acidosis- bicarb, dialysis if refractory

Treat underlying cause
Pre-renal- fluid resuscitation
Renal- immunosuppression
Post-renal- nephrotomy
INDICATIONS FOR DIALYSIS:
1. complications of uraemia- encephalopathy, pericarditis
2. refractory hyperkalemia
3. oliguria
4. refractory acidosis

Raised MCV and raised gamma GT=alcohol or vit deficiency
Onset- incidious higher creatinine than urea, acutely urea goes up before creatinine.

Chronic renal failure
Persistent and irreversible reduction in renal function
stage 1- >90ml/min
2- 60-90
3- 30-60
4- 15-30
end stage

Causes- most common- diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis
Multisystemic- perpheral neuropathy, restless legs syndrone, triedness and fatigue
Cardiovascular: 1.fluid overload 2. accelerated atherogenesis 3. uraemic perdicarditis
GI- altered taste perception; reduced absorption of calcium- failure of hydrolyation---hyperparathyroidism
Electrolyte- hyperkalaemia
Blood- reduced EPO secretion- anaemia of chronic disease; impaired platlet function due to the uraemia

Management
conservative- education, planning for dialysis, fluid resus
Medical - treat cardiovascular risk factor aggressively
Sugery- renal replacement therapy.</p>",1327,10,46,2012-12-31 15:41:23 UTC,2012-12-31 15:41:23 UTC

-USS s
MOST COMMON SITE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT THEN AREOLAR AREA
Remember- triple assessment!
stage 1- confined to the breast; 2- isplateral nodes, 3-chest wall= internal mammary, 4- metastic...liver, bones lungs.

TREATMENT- MDT crucial
early disease and late disease
Aims- local clearnace- wide local excision+radiotherapy or mastectomy (large central masses) Sam survival but less reoccurence in mastectomy.
Axillary management- axillary sampling; sentinal node mapping- inject radioisotope, if sentinnel node not involved then axillary clearnace not need.
Clearance- total clearance above pect minor

Prevent reoccurenct:
radiotherapy- after WLE+ in mets
chemotherapy- recurrence, large, young
Hormonal- tamoxifen/arimidex

Reconstruction- TRAM flap...after mastectomy or Lat.dorsi flap- cut lat dorsi and swing in round, inplants, replace nipple

ADVANCED DISEASE
1st line- tamoxifen
local recurrence- re-excision, radiotherapy,
metastatic- bisphosphonates, steroids

Less common
3. Peritoneal dialysis
4. Hypothyroidism
5. Nephrotic syndrome.
6. Mitral stenosis.
7. Constrictive pericarditis.

Exudate- permeability of vasculature has changed- proteins leak out.

Common
1. Malignancy- invades the vasculature.
2. Parapneumonic effusions- inflammatory. with pneumonia.
3. TB

Less common.

4. PE
5. Pancreatitis
6. Post MI

Abscess- a collection of pus that occurs within an unnatural body cavity.

Bloods - Serum bilirubin (venous sample), FBC, blood group, coombs test, Capillary blood gas to check for infection, septic screen, TFTs for hypo, Hep serology, Red blood cell defects and test for CF

Imaging - Rule out biliary atresia, liver biolsy or US.</p><strong>Importance</strong><br /><br /><p>Over 60% newborns become jaundiced and this may by physiological however may be down to underlying disease. Can have serious consequences. serum unconjugated bilirubin is nephrotoxic.</p><p>Causes: 
Within 24 hours is usually a haematological condition. e.g.rhesus hemolytic disease, ABO incompatability, G6PD deficiency, spherocytosis, congenital infection.

Between 24 hours and two weeks can be physiological or breast milk jaundice. hemolytic disorders and infection.

Over 2 weeks must split unconjugated and conjugated. 
Unconjugated - physiological, Breast milk jaundice, infection, hypothyroidism, hemolytic disorders.
Conjugated - Sepsis, TPN, neonatal hepatitis, CF, bile duct obstruction.

Physiological jaundice is very common often starting at 24 Hours old and peaks in a few days however will resolve by day 14.
Due to immaturity of the hepatic bilirubin conjugation.
Action required if serum biirubin is >260mmol/l

Breast Milk Jaundice
exacerbation of jaundice due to contents of breast milk

Infection
1. poor fluid intake by infant
2. hemolysis
3. reduced hepatic funcion
4. increase in enterohepatic circulation

Conjugated jaundice is suggested by dark urine and pale stools.
Biliary atresia is an important cause.

Cystic Fibrosis,"<strong>Background</strong><br /><br /><p>Autosomal recessive multisystem disorder which affects the respiratory tract by causing recurrent infection and also involves pancreatic insufficiency.

Carrier rate is 1 in 25 with an incidence of 1 in 2500 live births

disease gives a life expectancy of 30-40 years.</p><strong>Genetics</strong><br /><br /><p>Mutation to CFTR gene

Over 1000 mutations identified

Most common is deltaF508 - 76% in UK</p><strong>CFTR</strong><br /><br /><p>CFTR is a glycoprotein which has 1400 amino acids. It is found in eipthelial cells of airways and the ducts of the pancreas, biliary system and vas deferens.

Protein has 5 domains, 2 of which are membrane spanning which bind to a nucleotide in the cytoplasm. 

Chloride channel which when activates opens and closes sodium channels. 

Loss of function results in decreased secretion of chloride and increased resorption of sodium</p><strong>Pathogenesis</strong><br /><br /><p>Loss of function of CFTR - decreased secretion of choloride and increaed resorption of sodium and with it water in those epithelial cells and so viscous mucus is produced.

Airway surface liquid is reduced which inhibits ciliary function and leads to chronic infection and inflammation leading to lung damage. 

Other features 
85% have pancreatic insufficiency. 
Reduction of water content of secretions
pancreatitis common

GI reduced water and chloride into duct and can cause meconium ileus and also distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. 

In live reduced CFTR epithelial cells of biliary tract increass chance of obstructibe cirrhosis due to biliary plugging.

Sweat glands - High sweat salt content. 

Vas deferens - azospermic due to agenesis

Mild mutations can cause isolated congental vas deferenns abnormalitis.

Respiratory System Overview,"<strong>Lung Development</strong><br /><br /><p>Develops from endoderm after undergoing extensive branching, morphogenesis, alveolisation, angiogenesis and vascularisation at 28 Days.

Lung maturity is critical limiting factor in postnatal viability of premature babies
-Respiratory distress syndrome 
-Surfactant deficiency.

Five main periods to lung development. 

Embryonic: up to 7 wk
- Primitive trachea separates from primitive oesophagus
- Primary bronchial branches arise
- Lobar airways lined with endoderm established.

Pseudoglandular phase - 7-17wks
- Airway formation completer

Canalicular phase - 17-27
- Branching of peripheral airways completed by week 24
- Peripheral airways enlarge and are lined with thin epithelium

This is formed from type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes. 

Type 1 pneumocytes are responsible for gas exchange and cover the majority of the alveolar area. They are unable to replicate and so are susceptible to a toxic insult

Type 2 pneumocytes are found at the alveoli-septal junction and are responsible for the production and secretion of surfactant and can replicate and replace damaged type 1 pneumocytes. 

Sacular phase - 28-36 weeks.
-  Sac shaped distal airways extend to form cup shaped alveoli (NB prematurity)

Alveola phase from 36 onwards
Alveoli multiply
At birth 30-50% of adult number of alveoli are present. 

Postnatal lung growth
x 10 increse in alveolar numbers from birth to 3 years. 

Prepubertal girls airways bigger however post boys bigger.</p><strong>Mechanics of breathing</strong><br /><br /><p>Newborn infants have an abdominal breathing pattern
intercostals muscles are weak compared with diaphragm and so the descent during inspiration is accompanied by outward displacement of the abdominal wall. 
Chest wall becomes less compliant with age
chest wall becomes the primary mechanism of increasing intrathoracic volume during respiration.

Infants are obligate nose breathers. (6 months of life)



</p><strong>Lung Volumes and Capacities</strong><br /><br /><p>Tidal Volume - Volume of air inspired and expired during breathing. 

Residual volume - is total air remaining in lungs after maximal expiration. 

Total lung capacity - Volume in lungs after maximal inspiration.
TLC = Inspiratory reserve volume + Tidal volume + Expiratory reseve volume + residual volume.

Vital Capacity - Volume of air that can be exhaled after maximal inhalation.
</p><strong>Lung Function Tests</strong><br /><br /><p>Airway Function
Lung Volumes
Gas Exchange

Uses:

risk for surgery
distinguish between various disorders

Spirometry - over 5 years who can follow simple instructions

Maximal breath in then out as hard and fast as possible. 

Measurements taken are the forced vital capacity and the forced expiratory volume 

RATIO= 75-80%

Obstructive - airflow limitation - lower peak during expiration and scalloped appearance with a decreased FEV1 and the ration is less than 80%. TLC is normal or increased. Reversibility - bronchodilator and repeat after 15 minutes and if incresse by 15% then it is reversible. 

Restrictive - diminished lung volumes. FVC and resp flow reduced and ratio is incressed. TLC and forced vital capacity is reduced. 

</p><strong>Defence mechanisms and immunity</strong><br /><br /><p>Mucus secretion is an important physical barrier which is disrupted in CF

Ciliary action propels mucus and this is disrupted in ciliary dyskinisia.
Innate immunity - ciomplement, lysosyme.
Cellular immunity in direct combat of viruses and bacteria.</p>",943,22,173,2012-12-31 15:40:51 UTC,2012-12-31 15:40:51 UTC

ALANINE TRANSAMINASE (AMINOTRANSFERASE) (ALT) (10-40IU/L / 5-40U/L)
ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE (AST) (12-40U/L
ie. both normal range ~ 0-50units
ast rises more than alt in booze and cirrhosis
only 3 things >1000
ischaemia - hypoperfusion of liver in acute liver failure
viruses - hepb

extrahepatic (biliary obstruction)
other sources - bones, placenta, kidney

patterns
alp disprop high in biliary damage
amino transferases elevated more than alp hepatocyte damage

ALBUMIN (35-50g/L)
albumin - major synth product of liver ~50% 
long half life thf marker of more chronic
loss from gut, kidneys, burns, sepsis, malnutrition

PROTHROMBIN
prothrombin

indicator of early hepatic damage

BILIRUBIN (<17umol/L / 0.3-1.5mg/dl)
bilirubin

usu occurs in spleen
unconjugated transported with albumin
glucuronyl transferase
conjugated - water soluble (no need for albumin) secreted into bile
reaches duodenum reduced to stercobilinogen
some secreted by kidneys as urobilinogen

shouldn't be conjugated in blood - bilirubinuria
always pathological - lack of stercobilinogen = pale stools
jaundice results from hyperbilirubinaemia - does not occur until bili quite high
prehepatic - inc production of bili unconjugated due to haemolysis 
not excreted by kidneys so urine remains normal
hepatobiliary complication - pigment gallstones
hepatocellular jaundice - impaired uptake or conjugation - disease affecting
hepatocytes - usu mixture of conjugated and unconjugated
common cause of isolated raised bilirubin = gilberts syndrome glucuronyl transferase

Drugs in Psychiatry II,"<p>ANTIPSYCHOTICS
In psychotic disorders, bipolar/depression with psychotic features, delirium, behavioural disturbances in dementia. N+V and intractable hiccups.
Block D2 receptors in mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Typical- block all D2 receptors. Atypical have less affinity for D2 but also block 5-HT. Both also block muscarinic, histaminergic and alpha adrenergic receptors. Typical e.g. haloperidol, flupentixol, sulpiride. Atypical e.g. clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, amisulpride 
EPSEs = pseudoparkinsonism (muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor), acute dystonia (involuntary, sustained muscle contraction e.g. clenched jaw, oculogyric crisis), akasthia (restlessness), tardive dystkinesia (rythmic involuntary movement- chewing, grimacing, protruding tongue). 
Anticholinergic= dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision
Alpha-adrenergic = postural hypotension (dizziness, syncope)
Histamine blockade = sedation, weight gain
Cardiac = long qt, arrhythmias
Hyperprolactinaemia = PL is under inhibitory control of dopamine and so when dopamine decrease, PL increases --> galactorrhoea, amenorrhea, gynaecomastia, hypogonadism, sexual dysfunction. Dermatological e.g. photosensitivity, loweer seizure threshold, haematological 
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome = Life threatening, 20% mortality. 0.5% treated with typical. 4-5 days of initiation or change in dose. Motor signs- severe rigidity, Mental signs - fluctuating conciousness, Autonomic disturbance - hyperthermia, unstable BP, tachy, sweating. On bloods = high CK levels and abnormal LFTs. Stop antipsychotic immediately and call for help. SSRIs and lithium can also cause this. 

Clozapine --> agranulocytosis; regular fbc regularly 
Risperidone --> weight gain, increased prolactin
Olanzapine --> weight gain, sedation, high risk of diabetes
Amisulpiride --> increased prolactin 

BENZODIAZEPINES 
e.g. lorazepam, temazepam - these are short acting (hypnotics)
e.g. diazepam, chlordiazepoxide - these are long- acting (anxiolytics)
Potentiate the action of GABA (the main inhibitory NT in the brain) 
Effective as hypnotics, anxiolytic, anticonvulsants and muscle relaxants
Rapid symptomatic relief for acute anxiety - when severe, disabling or very distressing. Tied you over whilst other treatments take effect. 4 weeks absolute max. SSRIs start working throughout. 
Side effects - drowsiness, ataxia and reduced co-ordination (warn if driving!), headaches and confusion, respiratory depression. Risk of dependency. 
Overdose = antedote is flumanazil. Alcohol opiates TCAs and antihistamines enhance the effect and increase risk of resp depression. 
Zopiclone, zolpidem and zalepon = sleeping tablets
Buspirone 5ht1a receptor antagonist. no dependency. can be used long term. can take 2 weeks to take effect.

Eating Disorders,"<p>EATING DISORDERS 
Young adult caucasian females, higher social class, above average intelligence, increasing in 'westernising' cultures. F>M (10x)

ANOREXIA NERVOSA
Peak onset 18 
Self-induced weight loss BMI <17.5 or <85% of expected weight (younger patients)
Morbid fear of fatness- overvalued idea, self-set low weight threshold
Endocrine disturbance - amenorrhoea 
Restriction or purgative methods - vomiting, laxatives, exercise. Thyroxine, diuretics, insulin stopped
Anaemia, dehydration, poor circulation, anugo hair, sleep disturbance, muscle wasting

BULIMIA NERVOSA 
Peak onset 21
Binging - preoccupation in food and loss of control
Purging- compensatory behaviour, self induced vomiting, laxatives, exercise, periods of starving and appetitie suppression
Fear of fatness

Minimisation of seriousness 
Changes in mood, elevated mood then low mood 
Bulimia not typically associated with weight loss- if weight loss meets anorexia, its anorexia! 
Attitude to hunger- restriction --> happiness in anorexia, --> irritability in bulimia 
DDX depression, ocd, personality disorder, brain tumour, thyroid disease, malabsorption syndromes 

Management- 
Weight gain in anorexia. Soft milky food, half portions and then full portions. May be inpatient care if bmi <13.5. or rapid weight loss, dangerous physical problems, group or individual therapy. SSRIs or low dose olanzapine. Medical supplements. Prognosis in anorexia- 20% recover, 20% severe, 60% relapse or still have preoccupation with food. 1/3 suicide. Mortality over 5 years is 5%. 
SSRIs e.g. fluoxetine and CBT in bulimia </p>",849,21,89,2012-12-31 15:40:41 UTC,2012-12-31 15:40:41 UTC
Anxiety Disorders,"<p>ANXIETY DISORDERS:
Generalised Anxiety Disorder- persistent and excessive anxiety, out of place with the patients situation. 5%. F>M. 15-25 years onset. Genetics e.g. avoidant/anxious personality. Environmental - anxious parent, and stressful situations in a patients life can both predispose and perpetuate GAD.  Symptoms - free floating anxiety symptoms. Apprehensional- poor concentration, feeling on edge, preoccupation with events, motor- restlessness, trembling and headaches, autonomonic- lightheadedness, breathlessness, sweating. Depersonalisation - a loss of sense of identity, feel they arent real. Derealisation - surroundings dont feel real. DDX include panic disorder, phobic disorder, ocd, schizophrenia, drug withdrawal, phaeochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, unexpressed worries e.g. breast lump. Management- counselling, self help books, cognitive therapy, anxiety management techniques e.g. relaxation. Pharmacotherapy- short acting e.g. benzodiazapines, long acting e.g. SSRIs, SNRIs (venlafaxine), beta blockers, low dose antipsychotics.  

PANIC DISORDER- periods of severe anxiety. Fear of dying or losing control- SOB, chest pain, dizziness, palpitations, tremor. +/- avoidance. F>M. 1-2% of population. 20-40 years onset. Genetic component- predisposition to autonomic arousal. Rule out organic. Management is CBT - v effective. Drugs are less effective e.g. SSRIs or clomipramine (a TCA). 

PHOBIC DISORDER- inappropriate situational anxiety and avoidance. Agoraphobia, fear of crowds and open public spaces, specific phobias e.g. snakes, flying, spiders, social phobia- fear of ensnarement in social context. Behavioural therapy- systemic desensitixation- phobic stimulus or flooding, CBT. SSRIs, TCAs, benzos, B blockers. Depression frequently co-morbidity. 

OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER- obsessive thoughts (intrusive thoughts, catastrophic thinking), Compulsions (actions). Can co-exist in depressive disorders, GAD, and anorexia. Can recognise that its 'silly' but cannot stop it. Management- CBT is effective - easier to treat rituals than ruminations. SSRIs or TCAs for ruminations. Benzos for short terma anxiety. </p>",849,21,91,2012-12-31 15:40:41 UTC,2012-12-31 15:40:41 UTC
Schizophrenia,"<strong>Look up schizophrenia syndrome </strong><br /><br /><p>A lack of contact with reality together with psychotic symptoms. ""Shattering of the mind"" 
Lifetime risk = 1%. 15-35 presentation. Later in women. 
20% acute and full recovery, 20% recurrent acute episodes, 20% chronic starting acute, 20% chronic starting insidious, 10-15% commit suicide. 
Favourable prognostic factors include acute onset, higher social class, female and high iq.
Aetiology not clear. Multi-factorial. Genetics (sibling? 10-15% chance) (both parents? 40% chance). Env (complicated pregnancy, low social class, cannabis, multiple adverse life events). Neurodevelopmental (CT MRI changes esp temporal lobes with soft neuro signs).
2 common presentations: 
ACUTE SYNDROME (positive symptoms)
Restless, preoccupied, withdrawn, blunting and incongruety, pressure/poverty of speech, thought blocking, functional thought disorder e.g word salad. Hallucinations prominent often auditory. Impaired cognition with time. Lack of insight!
and CHRONIC (negative symptoms). Characterised by lack of drive, social withdrawal and impaired living skills. Movement disorders can also occur - catatonic symptoms e.g. stupor, excitment.
presentation- increased age there is increased paranoia. more severe in women and high emotional expression. 
diagnosis- schneiders first rank symptoms include passivity, thought possession, delusional perception and hallucinations (commentary or 3rd person). Need functional too e.g. impaired occupation. At least 1 month or 6 months (ICD-10, DSM). Vigorous exclusion of organic or mood disorders or drugs if diagnosed earlier. 
Isolated delusions may be - delusional disorder. 
Treatment: 
ACUTE- exclude other ddx. e.g. psychotic mood disorders. Drugs used are behavioural (e.g. benzos) antipsychotics, ECT (severe depression or catatonic stupor),
Continue using antipsychotic minimum 6 months. 
If dont recover mdt care package. 6 monthly assessment. looking at dose and SEs of drug.
Anticholinergics reduce parkinsonism but cause dyskinesias. Psychological therapy CBT and family therapy (to reduce expressed emotion).</p>",849,21,,2012-12-31 15:40:41 UTC,2012-12-31 19:16:08 UTC
Mood Disorders,"<p>Mood Disorders Podcast: 

Depressive, bipolar, persistent mood disorders. Don't forget suicide and parasuicide.

Depressive Episodes: F>M Late 30s average age of onset 
Clinical features include low mood, anhedonia, reduced energy, reduced attention and concentration, low self esteem, ideas of guilt and worthlessness. Hopelessness is a major risk factor for suicidal thoughts. Biological features include initial insomnia/broken sleep/early morning waking, reduced appetite, weight loss, diurnal variation in mood, constipation, reduced libido and amenorrhoea. 
On examination- downturned eyes, expressionless face or frown, weight loss, poor self care/neglect, psychomotor retardation, slow quiet monotonous speech, often monosyllabic. Low mood- sad, feelings of hopelessness, anxious or irritable too. Pessimistic thoughts, delusions and suicidal thoughts. Poor concentration and pseudo-dementia. 
Other patterns include depressive stupor (akinetic and mute in full conciousness), masked depression (somatic symptoms, +/- attention seeking behaviour), SAD (lowest mood in autumn and winter). 
DDx organic disorders, substance misuse, schizophrenia (negative symptoms) 
Management- depends on severity. Severe (suicidal) may require admission. Anti-depressants (SSRIs are first line, venlafaxine, mirtazipine -who need sedation, TCAs if severe), ECT, psychotherapies (cognitive therapy, group therapy, psychoanalytical, family/marital). 
Prognosis - relapse rate is 50%. Reduced risk if 6 months continue of medication. 9% overall suicide rate.

Bipolar disorder: At least one episode of mania usually accompanied by at least one episode of depression. M=F. Lifetime risk 1%. Age = 20s. 
Aetiology- genetics (FH), personality (borderline, depressive traits), psychosocial life events or physical illness may trigger. Social, sleep may perpetuate. 
Clinical features- elevation in mood, increased energy, reduced sleep, overspending, unrealistic projects, sexual disinhibition, negelct to eat/hygeine, irritable or angry. Grandiose delusions. 
On examination - flamboyant or revealing clothing, self neglect if severe, overactive behaviour, increased rate, pressure, difficulty interruption, euphoric mood or irritable/angry. Grandiose ideas or inflated importance, flight of ideas, clang/rhyming association, appreciation of colours or textures, hyperacusis, hallucinations, poor concentration and attention,  insight is absent during episode, but upon realisation can trigger depressive episode.
DDx organic, substance misuse, schizophrenia, agitated depression, severe OCD, hypomania (mild elevation in mood, energy etc but does not disrupt life).
Managment- admission during acute episode with anti-psychotics. Lithium for prophylaxis or carbamazapine. ECT for manic stupor or 3rd line. Psychosocial - education and family therapy.

Persistent mood disorders - cyclothymia (mild depression, mild elation, left untreated or lithium) and dysthmia (depressive neurosis, chronic depression of mood not fulfilling criteria for depressive episode)</p>",849,21,90,2012-12-31 15:40:41 UTC,2012-12-31 15:40:41 UTC
Anaemia,"<strong>Reduced production</strong><br /><br /><p></p><strong>Increased destruction</strong><br /><br /><p>Called haemolysis- reduction in red cell lifespan. 

Extravascular or intravascular haemolysis but can be cross over!
Extravascular e.g. splenic macrophages
Intravascular e.g. 

Clinical features of haemolysis include: 

Acute crises on chronic haemolysis. 

Raised unconjugated bilirubin, reduced haptoglobin (protein bniding to free Hb removed by RES, raised LDH, raised urinary urobilinogen, presence of reticulocytes (blueish tinge-polychromasia). Large immature red cells >2% is reticulocytosis. This can cause a mild macrocytosis. 

Intrinsic red cell problems are INHERITED

Divided into:
Membrane- hereditary spherocytosis, eliptocytosis. Problem with spectrin or anchorin proteins on cell membrane leading to reduced red cell lifespan due to abnormal shape, causing trapping in the spleen. Both AD inheritance. Spherocytosis is more common and severe. Eliptocytosis is rare and mild. Blood film- spherocytes and eliptocytes! Osmotic fragility test used in spherocytosis. Spherocytosis can be treated with splenectomy and folate supplementation. 

Cytoplasm- G6PD deficiency. The cells are lacking in key enzyme needed to produce NAPDH which helps protect the cell from oxidative damage. X-linked condition, seen in African and Chinese populations. Chronic haemolytic or acute haemolytic self limiting episodes caused by ppt that causes oxidative stress on the cells e.g. drugs (anti-malarials and sulphonamides), fava beans and infection. Blood film shows Heinz bodies (cellular inclusions) and bite cells. Diagnosed with fluorescent spot test outside of acute episode.

Haemoglobin- sickle cell and thalassaemia. Sickle cell disease is caused by a point mutation on the Beta globin chain. Homozygous = sickle cell disease. Heterozygous = sickle cell trait. HbS is insoluble at low oxygen tensions --> reduced flexibility and local hypoxia by micro-occlusion. Ppt by infection, dehydration and hypoxia. Shorted survival due to abnormal cells - chronic haemolytic state, splenomegaly, gall stones, folate deficiency, aplastic anaemia. Vaso-occlusive crises --> impaired passage and obstruction of small vessels causing infarction. Bone pain, osteomyelitis (salmonella), dactylitis, priapism, lower limb ulceration, retinopathy and tubular intersistial nephritis. Life threatening complications are pulmonary syndrome (causing pulmonary HTN) and stroke. Diagnosed with Hb electrophoresis- single band of HbS. Solubility test. Treatment - warming, fluids and antibiotics. Prevention with vaccination, penicillin prophylaxis and folate. Hydroxyurea increases levels of HbF, slowing the clinical course. 
Thalassaemia- imbalanced Alpha and Beta globin chain produciton. Failure of synthesis and reduced lifespan. Common in meditaranian, SE asia, afria. Alpha thalassaemia (lack of alpha globin chains) and Beta thalassaemia. Beta is most common and can get major (homo) and miner (hetero). Major presents early and requires blood transfusion. Minor present later with mild haemolysis anaemia. Major has extramedullary haemoatopoeises, liver, spleen and bony expansion e.g. frontal bossing. Iron accumulation due to repeated transfusion. Can have liver, heart pancreas problems. Alpha is less common. All 4- hydrops fetalis. 3- HbH disease, moderate anaemia and splenomegaly. 1 and 2- asymptomatic. 

Extrinsic red cell problems are ACQUIRED 
Exception is paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobulinuria as this is the only acquired intrinsic defect. 

Immune haemolysis. Autoantibody problems and alloantibody problems e.g. neonatal or blood transfusion. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia - red cell haemolysis intra and extra-vascularly. History of other autoimmune conditions. Drugs. Positive direct combes test. 2 types- warm (IgG) and cold (IgM)  (the temp at which the autoantibodies are reactive). Warm is more common- causes include idiopathic, autoimmune e.g. lupus, myeloproliferative disorders e.g. CLL and lymphoma, penicillin, methyldopa and quinine. Cold causes include infections EBV and mycoplasma and lymphoma. Steroids to induce remission and then if relapse immunosuppression. May require splenectomy- but not effective in cold haemolytic anaemia (as haemolysis is mainly in the liver!). 

Non-immune haemolysis. Mechanical problems or PNH. 
Red cells are suffering trauma- microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia e.g. DIC, HUS, thrombocytopenic purpura (abnormal proudcts of coagulation depsited in vessels causing mechanic damage). Other causes include mechanical heart valves and march haemoglobulinuria (repeated trauma, schistocytes on blood film). 

Exception PNH. Acquired mutation. Red cell defect causing problems with cell surface of all cell lines. Intravascular haemolysis, clotting e.g. VTE, haemoglobulinuria at night or early morning. Diagnoses with Hams test or cytometric analysis. Treatment with supplemets, anticoaulation and monoclonal antibodies against C5 complement. </p>",849,7,32,2012-12-31 15:40:41 UTC,2012-12-31 15:40:41 UTC
LIVE - Fluid Resus in Surgery,"<p>surgical fluids: osce notes

types: 
crystalloid (N saline 154mmol, dextrose, Hartmann's, Ringer's)
normal saline- vomiting, diarrhoea
dextrose is like giving someone water, not increasing blood sugar
Hartmann's- used intraoperatively. contains calcium, lactate; which is metabolised by the liver to bicarbonate. more physiological than N saline. 
colloid- gelofusin, albumin: note, can cause anaphylaxis
difference between colloid and crystalloid is that colloid is used to stay in intravascular space for longer than crystalloid (i.e. for vascular blood loss)
blood- haemorrhaging or low Hb.

How much fluid is needed per day: 3L
Sodium per day: 100 mmol
K per day: 60 mmol

Transfusion levels- occur at about 8 Hb or if symptomatic

Low sodium:
confusion
Quick blood result via ABG machine (can be venous)

Low potassium
confusion
tachycardic

Preop patient who is NBM

8h bags of (over 24h)
N saline + dextrose + dextrose (and 20mmol KCL in each bag)

this is 125ml per hour

Exeptions are heart failure etc

Post op: avoid K for 1st 48h, because of cell lysis caused during surgery

read op notes and find out what the losses are, and check fluid losses (ins and outs)
Check pre-op observations to know what's normal for that patient (e.g. previous BP of 160 now 100)
most pt will have a catheter- remember 0.5ml/kg/hr
remember to watch out for fluid overload- SOB, oedema. Look at the JVP, listen to the chest (crackles), check fluid balance. If very overloaded, think about a diuretic (furosemide, 40mg IV)

Post op pyrexia:
consider
infection, response to trauma, were they pre-op infection (check notes). atelexisis is reparatory depression and small lung collapse due to being under anaesthetic for long time. physio is needed.

the most common infection post op is urinary due to catheter insertion
always consider post op DVT (tachycardia)
check TED stockings, prescribe heparin

special surgical fluid cases

pancreatitis:
amylase leaking
dehydration

Burns
types are
partial thickness (very painful)
full thickness (white and not painful)
other one: (blisters and very painful)

Signs: oedema. 

Acute heart failure, circulatory collapse, and chronic heart failure.</p><p>Acute heart failure - pulmonary oedema, circulatory collapse, cardiogenic shock characterised by poor peripheral perfusion, oliguria and hypertension. </p><p>Chronic heart failure - congestive, undulating or compensated. </p><p>5 main categories of causes - arrhythmias, valve disease, pericardial disease, myocardial disease (ischaemic heart disease, hypertension) and congenital heart disease.

Others - dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

Also caused by high output states - severe anaemia, thyrotoxicosis, pregnancy, beri-beri, paget's disease, septicaemia.</p>",627,2,,2012-12-31 15:40:09 UTC,2012-12-31 19:16:06 UTC
Leukaemia,"<p>Malignancies of bone marrow origin - mutation in a haematopoietic stem cell, resulting in disrupted differentiation and maturation of its progeny. Causes include radiation, benzene, HTLV-1, gene mutations.

4 types of chromosomal abnormalities - translocations, deletions (AML), duplications (AML), point mutations. End result is disrupted differentiation and maturation. 

No/very little differentiation --> immature, undifferentiated blasts in bone marrow which proliferate, overwhelm other cells, and spill out into the blood --> acute leukaemia.

Differentiation --> reduced proliferative capacity --> chronic/indolent disease.

Myeloproliferative disorders - mutated but well differentiated. Disease depends on which cell line is dominant - erythrocytes is polycythemia vera, megakaryocytes is essential thrombocythemia, neutrophils is CML. 

Ineffective differentiation - poorly differentiated cells which get killed in bone marrow --> myelodysplastic syndromes.

All chronic malignancies can get more mutations over time and become acute.</p><p>Lymphoma - a malignancy outside bone marrow. Tends to present with a solid mass lesion, rather than with symptoms of pancytopenia. 

Myeloma - a malignancy of plasma cells. The cells are terminally differentiated, and then they go back to the bone marrow and proliferate. So bone marrow symptoms, and peripheral symptoms mainly due to immunoglobulins produced by the cells. </p><p>Acute leukaemia - myeloblastic or lymphoblastic. To diagnose must have >20% blast cells in either peripheral blood or bone marrow. Immunophenotyping used to determine myeloid or lymphoid origin, and karyotyping to determine specific mutations, helpful with planning treatment and giving prognosis. </p><p>ALL - commonest in children, peak age 4. Organ infiltration with blasts common - lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenoegaly, CNS, testes. Complex classification based on immunological markers on cells e.g. CD10 is common. Pre-B ALL, B ALL or T ALL. Very responsive to treatment.</p><p>AML - more common in adults. Can occur de novo, but usually associated with another haematological malignancy e.g. CML, myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic disorders, chemo for solid tumours.  Organ infiltration usually rare, except with one subtype, in which their is gum and skin infiltration. 30% hour rods in the blast cells. </p><p>Management of acute leukaemias: supportive (blood products, abx to treat infection etc) and specific (chemo and often stem cell transplant). Induction phase (aims to achieve remission), intensification cycle, maintenance therapy.</p><p>CLL - over 60, twice as common in men, usually an incidental finding. Proliferation of small lymphocytes in BM, which then spread in to blood, and then to lymph nodes, leading to lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, and later BM is overcome and there is BM failure. On blood film - lymphocytosis, smear cells, lymphocytic replacement of normal marrow on BM. Indolent course. Initially watch and wait. 5% can transform to a high grade B cell lymphoma (Richter's syndrome). If severe, chemo +/- BM transplant if young.</p><p>Myeloproliferative disorders - excess proliferation, with normal differentiation.Usually focussed on 1 cell line. Neutrophils --> CML, RBCs --> polycythemia vera, --> megakaryocytes --> essential thrombocythemia. Most of theses are accompanied by extramedullary haemopoiesis --> splenomegaly and risk of transformation to acute leukaemia.</p><p>Idiopathic myelofibrosis - rare. Marrow is replaced with collagen fibrosis, resulting in marrow failure and extra-medullary haemopoiesis. Massive hepatosplenomagaly. Presents incidentally/with cytopenias due to BM failure/with hepatosplenomegaly. Often a late presentation. Blood film shows a leukoerythroblastic picture. Pathognomic is tear drop poikyocytes. BM aspirate is dry. BM trephine shows prominant megakarycyte hyperplasia, osteosclerosis (new bone formation) and prominent collagen synthesis. BM the only treatment (for young pts). Otherwise, supportive treatment. Splenomegaly makes it WORSE.</p><p>CML is a MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER. 95% philadelphia chromosome. Lots of differentiated neutrophils in blood. Chronic phase lasts ~5 years easily treated, then an accelerated phase, and then the blast phase (transforms to an acute leukaemia which is refractory to treatment). Blood leukocytosis philadelphia chromosome positive, thrombocytopenia, anaemia. Treatment - imatinib - a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Prevents cellular disregulation. BM transplant the only curative treatment,curative in 50%. </p><p>Myelodysplastic syndromes - a group of neoplastic haematopoitic stem cells. Cells maintain ability to differentiate, but do so in a chaotic manner, so are apoptosed, resulting in pancytopenia. Organomegaly rare. Dysplastic cells seem in peripheral blood and BM. Hard to differentiate from B12/folate. Treatment supprotive but doesnt prolong survival. Stem cell transplants and chemo sometimes affective. Most patients suffer BM failure, and conversion to an acute leukaemia. </p>",627,7,,2012-12-31 15:40:09 UTC,2012-12-31 19:16:07 UTC

Diverticulosis = multiple diverticula present.
Diverticular disease = symptomatic
Diverticulitis = diverticulitis + infection</p><p>Diverticula can be described as true or false. True diverticula are composed of all layers of the intestinal wall, whereas false diverticula are formed from the herniation of the mucosal and submucosal layers only. Meckel's diverticulum is a true diverticulum, whereas diverticula seen in diverticular disease are false. </p><p>Diverticular disease: common, found in 30% of those over 60, often asymmptomatic, more common on women. Risk factors are obesity, low fibre diet, conditions causing increased intraabdominal pressure, hiatus hernia and cholelithiasis. </p><p>Saint's triad = diverticular disease + hiatus hernia + cholethiasis. </p><p>Most diverticulosis is asymmptomatic.

Appendicitis,"<p>Appendicitis = inflammation of the vermiform appendix. 
It is the most common diagnosis of acute UK general surgical take. 
Peak incidence 10-15 years. 7% of people in UK have it during their lifetime. Slightly more common in men. </p><p>Excellent prognosis if recognised and treated early. </p><p>Aetiology - thought to be due to obstruction by a fecolith (faeces stone), lymphoid hyperplasia, and more rarely in the UK, worms. In older patients, consider possibility of a tumour. Also phlegmenous appendicitis - associated with URTI, bacteria in appendix, sometimes called a grumbling appendix as has a slower less predictable course. </p><p>fecolith obstruction --> increased intra-luminal pressure and wall distension --> normal mucous secretion continues anyway increasing pressure further --> occlusion of lymphatic and venous supply --> more pressure --> occlusion of arterial supply --> ischemia --> necrosis --> loss of function allows bacterial translocation and multiplication --> can lead to perforation due to weakness in wall caused by bacterial infection and necrosis. This process takes 1-3 days. </p><p>Clinical features. Vague central abdo pain which worsens and localises to the right iliac fossa, worse on movement. Accompanied anorexia, nausea, vomiting and low grade fever (37.5-38.5). O/E increased temperature, dehydration, fetor oris, coated tongue. Restricted abdo wall movement on deep respiration due to generalised/localised peritonism. Tenderness over McBurney's point, which is found 1/3rd of the way from the line from the ASIS to the umbilicus. 

Eponymous signs in appendicitis: 
Rovsing's sign - palpation in left iliac fossa causes maximal pain in the right iliac fossa. 
Psoas stretch sign - painful hip flexion when patient lies supine. 
Obturator sign - painful hip flexion and internal rotation. Pain caused by obturator muscle touching inflammed appendix.

Gallbladder and Stones,"<p>ANATOMY: The gallbladder is found on the right hand side, mid-clavicular line, at the costal margin. It is located between the right and the quadrate lobes of the liver (the other lobes are the caudate and the left. The gallbladder has a fundus, a body and a neck.

Classify by location - 
1. Gallbladder: BILIARY COLIC (obstruction of the cystic duct) and ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS (obstruction + infection). Also rarer causes: mucocele, Mirizzi's syndrome and gallbladder carcinoma. 
2. In biliary tract: 
3. Outside biliary tract:</p><p>Colicky pain is caused by contraction of a hollow viscus caused by obstruction. </p><p>BILIARY COLIC: blockage of the cystic duct.

O/E mild RUQ tenderness.Not a true colic, which rises and falls, as it rises, stays stable and painful for several hours, and then falls. Management: ABC resuscitate, exclude emergency (e.g. pancreatitis, upper GI perforation, acute cholecystitis). Depending on severity: 1. conservative management (rehydration (esp. if dehydrated due to vomiting), NBM, analgesia (PETHIDINE 50mg every 4 hours orally or IM, must be pethidine to avoid syphincter of odi spasm) 2. Surgical - urgent cholecystectomy or elective cholecystectomy 6-12 weeks later, to allow for swelling to go down.</p><p>ACUTE COLECYSTITIS: obstructed gallbladder + infection. Patient more unwell. Severe, constant RUQ pain, > radiation to epigastrum. Systemically unwell. Low grade pyrexia. O/E more tender RUQ and positive Murphy's sign. Put you hand over the gallbladder (R MCV costal margin) and ask patient to breathe in. This pushes gallbladder down against your fingers, causing pain, which stops the patient inspiring further. Must check it is negative on the left. Note Murphy's only positive in 75% of cases of acute colecystitis.

Anaesthetic Drugs,"<p>Induction drugs - PROPOFOL +/- opoate e.g. fentanyl. 
MOA unknown. Main side effect of propofol is that it can reduce vascular tone, reducing systemic vascular resistance and central venous pressure, effecting cardiac output and BP. Mainly metabolised by the liver. Propofol stings a lot when it goes in. 

Thiopentone useful for rapid sequence induction. Short-acting barbituste. 'Dirty' causing post-op nausea. 

Sevoflurane - anaesthetic vapour commonly used in paeds anaesthesia. </p><p>Muscle relaxants: 
Depolarising - suxamethonium. Works within ~9 seconds, wears off after 7 minutes. Useful in rapid sequence induction. Binds to post-synaptic membrane blocking acetylcholine, and depolarises cell but keeps it depolarised for longer than acetylcholine, about 7 minutes. It is then broken down. Some people lack the enzyme that breaks it down, and so take longer than 7 mins to recover, so you must monitor for this. Pretty sure this was used in ECT in psych. 
Non-depolarising: 
Vecuronium, rocuronium, atracurium (can cause broncospasm so avoid in asthmatics, but is broken down in blood so gd for those with renal/liver impairment). Compete with acetylcholine, and then block the receptor, but dont depolarise the cell.</p><p>Maintenance drugs
Gases: desflurance (resp irritant, so avoid in asthmatics/smokers, but pts wake up quickly(, isoflurane (cheap but pts slow to wake up), sevoflurane (best but very expensive). 
Propofol infusion</p><p>Emergency drugs. 
Bradycardic but good BP - use an anti-cholingerics e.g. atropine, glycopyrulate. 
Low BP but heart rate OK - alpha agonist to cause peripheral vasoconstriction e.g. metaraminol, phenylepherine. Low BP and bradycardic - alpah and beta agnoists e.g. ephedrine. High BP and tachy - probs stressed due to surgery. Give analgesia e.g. paracetamol. morphine. If no improvement, use a beta antagonist e.g. labetolol, esmolol, or an aplha 2 agnoist e.g. clonidine, to reduce BP.</p><p>Reversal drugs: neostigmine (acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, increasing amount of acetylcholine in nerve terminal, so more to compete with the anaesthetic).

The Primary Survey,"<p>Initially - are they sick?

Yes - DR. If responsive, do primary survey. If not responsive, start BLS (obv beginning with assessing breathing and pulse in the usual way, followed by CPR if these are not present)
No - history and examination

If not in need of resuscitation BLS style, do a primary survey. 

If the situation changes at any point, go back to the beginning of ABCDE again. Re-assess. 

Common causes of unsafe airway - reduced GCS (e.g. head injury), foreign body obstruction (e.g. vomit), airway swelling (e.g. due to anaphylaxis). 

Airway manoevers - head tilt chin life/jaw thrus (esp if C spine)t; airway adjuncts (oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, supraglottic airway, LMA); defintitve airways (endotracheal tube, tracheostomy tube). 

Breathing. Assess - are they making respiratory effort, inspect chest, check resp rate. All sick/unstable patients should be given 15l high flow oxygen with reservoir mask. If they have a ventilation problem, may need CPAP or BiPAP.Start treating the underlying cause. 

Circulation. Examine - cool peripheries, capillary refill, BP, pulse rate and rhythm, obs, ECG, urine output, GCS. Insert cannula, take bloods, resuscitate with fluids/blood (depending on cause of sickness), catheterise if needed. 

Disability. Asses pupils (resting size, equality, reactions), temperature, GCS, AVPU. 

Exposure. Look for rashes, swellings/injuries, recent operation sites, hernias, signs of internal or external haemorrhage, DTV.

Assess patient quickly, and correct each step as you go through. 

Summary: 
- Well/unwell - is primary survey required?
- Get help
- ABCDE approach and treat each problem as found
- If situation changes, go back and start from airway again.</p>",627,24,99,2012-12-31 15:40:08 UTC,2012-12-31 15:40:08 UTC

Pneumonia LIVE,"<strong>Lung Infections</strong><br /><br /><p>We'll talk about TB at the end.</p><strong>Definition</strong><br /><br /><p>Infection & inflammation of the lung paenchyma
the most pathogens are bacterial.
We'll go through each of those & some of the antibiotics you might want to use.

When you look at someone with pneumonia try and identify host & pathogen factors that may have lead to the cause of the pneumonia - we'll go through that in a second.

So, immune related.
Non-immune related: so if they don't have any immunodeficiency they might have a mechanical deficiency (catagenous syndrome - has cilia that doesn't work - risk of retained secretions & develop a pneumonia more easily - likewise Cystic fibrosis are more prone to lung infections.)

Also related to the pathogen. So if you have a very VIRIAL pathogen then that's going to produce pneumonia who may be immuno-competent. And also the size of the dose. If you have one bacterium come in, then you're very unlikely to develop a pneumonia, whereas if you are sitting next to someone all day with a virus then you're more likely to pick up that virus, and again we'll see that with TB (the biggest risk factor with TB transmission is how long you spend with someone who's positive.

There are various methods of spread.

The most common one we think of is where the pneumonia is spread by droplet transmission in the air. So you breathe in and inhale bacteria.
It can also be caused by aspiration of your own nasopharygeal or gastric flora, so you give it to yourself, and you see aspiration pneumonias in people with neuromuscular disorders and such things.

Also, it can be spread haematogenously (I've said that right). That means it's come from somewhere else. If you've got a septic arthritis (perhaps with staph aureus) or you've got endocarditis, then that may spread to the lung via the blood - if you get a septicaemia.

Most common spread via air.</p><strong>Types</strong><br /><br /><p>There are various different types...

CAP/HAP - that's probably the biggest distinction in different pathogens.
Empyema - infection of fluid with with lung pleural space

CAP - in community. (exactly what it says on tin). most likely organisms...

The Outer Ear,"<p>Disorders of the outer ear
- ear wax - normally moves laterally along the canal, encouraged to do so by movement of skin epithelium. Discourage use of cotton buds. Ear wax impaction causes conductive deafness. 
- traumatic haematoma of the external ear. Occurs when blood builds up between the perichondrium and the cartilage. Causes disruption of blood supply to the cartilage- scarring, cauliflower ear. Haematomas should be drained with a wide bore needle, or excised. 
- infection - otitis externa - acute v chronic. acute otitis externa, boil in the external auditory meatus. Always in the outer third as this is the only bit with hair follicles. Presents acutely with pain that is made worse by moving the ear or chewing. Readily relieved by bursting the boil. Treatment is usually with daily glycerol and icthammol wicks. If there is any evidence of spreading cellulitis then consider antibiotics. Chronic otitis externa - Singapore ear, Hong Kong ear - charcaterised by itching, painless, discharge. Treatments include antibiotic and steroid eardrops (gentamicin and hydrocortisone), can use alluminium acetate for pseudomonas, nystatin for fungal. Viral ear infection otitis externa haemorrhagica or bullous myrangitis - painful blood blisters on the EAM or ear drum, when the rupture blood erupts. Treatment is with analgesia and reassurance as this usually gets better with time. Ramsay Hunt Syndrome - HSV migrates along the geniculate ganglion. Also facial nerve palsy. Treatment is with aciclovir. 
- Neoplastic lesions in the outer ear - two sites - pinna or in the EAM. Pinna - top of the pinna due to sunlight exposure (BCC SCC) need wide local excision. EAM - single pedunculated benign osteoma - outer part of EAM. Easy to remove surgically. Multiple exostoses - smooth sessile - common in swimmers - swimmers should be encouraged to drain water from their ears. </p>",262,19,,2012-12-31 15:39:25 UTC,2012-12-31 19:16:06 UTC
Hoarse Voice,"<p>Hoarseness (dysphonia) is the cardinal symptom of laryngeal disease. 
Dysphonia for longer than three weeks should be diagnosed as carcinoma until proven otherwise. Simple benign causes usually clear up within a week or two. Laryngeal carcinoma is easily treatable with radiotherapy. 
Causes
- carcinoma
- acute laryngitis
- chronic laryngitis
- laryngeal trauma - banging together of the vocal chords causes laryngeal oedema. 
- Singer's nodules/Clergyman's throat - small ones disappear with voice rest, whereas larger ones require surgery
- Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy - intrinsic muscles of the larynx are supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve

The nerve descends from the nucleaus ambiguus in the brainstem, through the jugular foramen, then alongside the pharynx in the neck, and on the left side around the ligamentum arteriosum into the chest. 

Carcinoma of the larynx, virtually never occurs in non-smokers. Location: 70% are glottic or on the vocal chords, 20% are supraglottic, and 10% are subglottic. Lesions tend to present very early because only a small lesion is required for it to cause hoarseness of the vocal chords. 

Most patients are treated successfully with radiotherapy. 

Hysterical aphonia, usually occurs in young females. Needs to treat psychiatric cause. 

Congenital cysts. Warts (juvenile laryngeal papillomata, usually disappear at puberty). </p>",262,19,,2012-12-31 15:39:25 UTC,2012-12-31 19:16:06 UTC

*** found between hepatocytes and endoth cells and store Vitamin A. 


Liver is like a big sponge:

 - holes = vasc sinusoids filled with blood flowing fro portal tracts on outside (hep artey, bile duct and portal vein) ---> central vein. </p><strong>Functions of Liver</strong><br /><br /><p>- metabolic e.g cholesterol synthesis
 - synthetic e.g. albumin, clotting factors. 
 - storage e.g cholesterol, glycogen
 - detoxification e.g alcohol, drugs.</p><strong>Hepatic failure definition</strong><br /><br /><p> - clinical syndrome with >90% reduction in functional capacity of liver.

2) Coagulopathy

3) Jaundice (usually conjugated bilirubin)

Upper GI Bleed,"<strong>Aetiology And Pathophysiology</strong><br /><br /><strong>Peptic Ulcer</strong><br /><br /><p>Commonest cause of UGI bleed - 50-70% of cases

Pathophys: Damage to gastric/duodenal mucosa due to inadequate protection from stomach acid caused by:
1. H.Pylori
2. NSAIDs
3. Steriods
4. Smoking. 

As the ulcer continues to erode into the mucosa, underlying blood vessels are exposed to the stomach contents and bleed.

Complication: PERFORATION (anterior vs posterior:  gastroduodenal artery runs posteriorly therefore more likely to bleed)</p><strong>Oesophageal Varices</strong><br /><br /><p>10% of UGI bleeds. 
Chronic liver disease leeds to portal hypertension.
This leads to dilatation of veins at sites of porto-venous anastamosis. 
This includes the lower oesphagus which results in the formation of dilated, tortuous veins ""varices"". If these rupture this can result in torrential upper GI bleeding. </p><strong>Mallory-Weiss Tear</strong><br /><br /><p>7% of UGI bleed. A small tear in the oesphagus caused by forceful vomiting, retching or coughing. </p><strong>Oesophagitis</strong><br /><br /><p>6% of UGI bleeds. (needs to be severe)
Inflammation of the Oesphagus
- GORD
- Candidiasis
- Chemical erosion
- Ionising radiation
Continued inflammation may leed to localised bleeding</p><strong>Dieulafoy's lesion</strong><br /><br /><p>Rare cause of UGI bleed. 
Prominent arteriole in the submucosa near the gastro-oesphageal junction may bleed into the stomach in the absence of an overlying ulcer.

-Bright red fresh blood. 
- Clots
- Coffee ground

advantage = metabolised mostly in blood and so advantageous in liver / renal disease (vecuronium and rocuronium broken down more in liver and excreted renally)</p><strong>Maintenance</strong><br /><br /><strong>Gases - Isoflurane, Desflurane, Sevoflurane</strong><br /><br /><p>[MAC = Mean Alveolar Concentration (conc of gas in alveoli required to keep 50% of men at sea level sufficiently anaesthetised not to respond to painful stimuli)]

MOA???

Isoflurane [MAC = 1.1]
- advantage - cheapest
- disadvantage - slow recovery

Desflurane [MAC = 6.6)
- side effect -respiratory irritant - contraindicated in smokers & asthma 
- advantage - quicker recovery

Sevoflurane [MAC = 2.2]
- advantage - best
- disadvantage - most expensive

**MAC relevance? - How deeply anaesthetised someone is?</p><strong>Propofol Infusion (TIVA) [Total IntraVascular Anaesthetic]</strong><br /><br /><p>Monitoring - BIS monitoring - how deeply anaesthetised is patient
- EEG method of monitoring - gives number 0-100 (100 = aware, anaesthetic aim = 50 [40-60], too low = too deep, too high = too awake)</p><strong>Emergency</strong><br /><br /><strong>HR DOWN, bp same</strong><br /><br /><p>Anti-cholinergics - e.g. Atropine, Glycopyrulate
**MOA - ? block parasympathetic input to heart (parasympathetic neurotrasmitter is Ach)</p><strong>BP DOWN, hr same</strong><br /><br /><p>Alpha-agonist - e.g. Metaraminol, Phenylepherine
MOA - cause peripheral vasoconstriction > increase SVR >increase BP</p><strong>BP DOWN, HR DOWN</strong><br /><br /><p>Alpha and Beta agonist - e.g. Ephedrine
**MOA ?</p><strong>BP UP, HR UP</strong><br /><br /><p>Patient responding to PAIN
Give analgesia - paracetamol or morphine

If not controlled:

Beta-antagonist - e.g. Labetolol, Esmolol

** ?Alpha 2 agonist - e.g. Clonidine
**MOA ?</p><strong>Reversal</strong><br /><br /><p>reversal of muscle relaxant so patient can resume breathing spontaneously again</p><strong>Neostigmine</strong><br /><br /><p>Pharmacology - Ach-esterase inhibitor

MOA - stops breakdown of Ach by Ach-esterase > increased conc of Ach in synapse > Ach displases muscle relaxant from post-synaptic nicotinic receptor > nerve cell resumes normal controlled intermittent depolarisation (rather than constant depolarisation by relaxants)

side effects
- major - also blocks Ach-esterase in cholinergic post-synaptic receptors i.e. parasympathetic neurons > can slow heart rate by increasing parasympathetic drive by increasing amount of Ach in synapse as it blocks Ach-esterase
Commonly used w/ anti-cholinergic for above reason - e.g. Glycopyrulate or Atropine
**contraindications?</p><strong>Post-Op</strong><br /><br /><strong>Anti-Emetic</strong><br /><br /><p>10 mins before patient wakes up, prophylactic, prescribed PRN

Drugs used:
Cyclizine
**MOA - H2 antagonist

Ondansetron
**MOA - 5HT3 antagonist (?dopamine)</p><strong>Analgesia</strong><br /><br /><p>See elsewhere, but:

Liver Function Test,"<p>Serum Markers of Liver Cell Damage
ALT and AST are enzymes contained in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and are involved in amino acid metabolism and become elevated when the cells die.  Their normal units are between 0 and 50.  ALT and AST are present in other tissues in small amounts.  AST rises more than ALT in alcohol and cirrhosis.  Ischeamia, viruses and toxins can put them above 1000.  GGT (gammaglutaryl transpeptidase) is a microsomal enzyme found in hepatocytes and bile ducts.  It is involved in amino acid metabolism.  It is useful for finding out that a raise in ALP is due to a liver cause.  It is raised with alcohol in the absence of disease and in the presence of drugs like phenytoin.  ALP (alkaline phosphatase) has a normal range of 40-150 and is found in sinusoidal and canulicular membranes of the liver.  Elevations occur with cholestasis and can be intrahepatic (liver damage) or extrahepatic (biliary obstruction).  Other sources are bones, placenta and kidneys.  A pattern of change can give a clue to the damage.  Extensory biliary damage will give high ALP compared to immunotransferases.  However in hepatitis immunotransferases will be high more than ALP.

Markers of function.  
Albumin is the major synthetic product of the liver.  It is used to maintain oncotic pressure and binding things like steroids and has a long half live so is a marker of chronic liver damage.  Apart from chronic liver disease it can be reduced with loss from the gut or kidneys, third spacing in burns or sepsis and malnutrition.  
As clotting proteins are made in the liver, a reduction in liver function leads to a reduction in the levels of clotting proteins and an increased prothrombin time.  Clotting factors have a shorter half life so are better for spotting early liver damage. 
Bilirubin is a useless toxic breakdown product of heamaglobin.  Breakdown occurs in the spleen.  Unconjugated bilirubin is transported bound to albumin to the liver where hepatocytes take it up. Glucuronyl transferase catalyses the binding of glucuronic acid in the process of conjugation so it is soluble.  It is then secreted into the bile where it reaches the duodenum and is reduced by bacteria to stercobillinigin for elimination in the faeces.  A small amount may be secreted in the kidneys as urobilinigin.  There should be no conjugated bilirubin in the blood normally, but liver and biliary disease impairs the pathway to the gut it accumulates in the plasma and is filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine as billirubinurea and is pathological.  In association is the pale stools due to lack of stercobillinigin.  Jaundice occurs when the bilirubin levels are very high.  Pre hepatic jaundice is due to an increased production of bilirubin which is due to increaced production of unconjugated bilirubin from haemolysis.  Urine colour is normal.  Pigmented gallstones suggests a long standing haemolytic cause.  Hepatocellular jaundice is impaired uptake or conjugation of bilirubin from any disease affecting hepatocytes,  The bilirubin will be a mix of conjugated and unconjugated.  Not all hepatocellular jaundice is from liver damage.  In Gilberts syndrome where glucuronyl transferase is reduced.  Patients get intermittent mild jaundice particularly after long periods without food or other illness.  Obstructive jaundice is from blockage of flow of bile at any level of the biliary tree.  Common causes are gallstones, carcinoma of the head of the pancreas or carcinoma of an extra hepatic bile duct.  It usually results in conjugated hyperbilirubineamia with dark urine and pale stools and itching.  
Alphafetoprotein may be raised in HCC, viral serology, autoantibodies iron and copper studies.  Radiology - us, ct, ercp and biopsies.</p>",17,4,,2012-12-31 15:38:56 UTC,2012-12-31 19:16:07 UTC
